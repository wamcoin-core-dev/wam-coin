//
//      node bots/announce.js [--config FILE] [--once] [--dry-run]
//
//  WHAT IT IS FOR
//  --------------
//  The founder of this project does not make public statements. That is a
//  deliberate position and a defensible one, but it leaves a channel with
//  nothing in it, and a silent channel reads as a dead project.
//
//  So the chain speaks instead. Everything this bot posts is a number read
//  from a node over RPC, which anyone can check against their own node. No
//  opinions, no promises, no price -- and nothing that requires a human to
//  write it.
//
//  WHAT IT POSTS
//  -------------
//      a heartbeat        once a day: height, hashrate, supply, next halving
//      halvings           the moment the block subsidy changes
//      key rotations      when the RandomX epoch turns over
//      releases           when a new version is published on GitHub
//      milestones         round heights and round millions of supply
//
//  and to the OPERATOR only, never to the public channel:
//
//      stalls             when no block has arrived for too long
//      recoveries         when they start arriving again
//
//  Stalls used to be public, on the reasoning that a channel which only
//  carries good news is advertising while one that reports its own outages is
//  a source. That reasoning holds for a live chain and this is not one yet.
//
//  Measured over the channel's whole life to 4 September 2026: 147 posts, 21
//  of them the daily heartbeat and 126 the chain reporting that it had
//  stopped. Eighty-six per cent of everything WAM had ever said in public was
//  "no new block for an hour" -- about a test network whose entire hashrate is
//  one laptop and one server, which therefore stops whenever the founder's
//  power does. It informed nobody and taught every reader that the project
//  stops constantly.
//
//  The alert still fires, every time, and still reaches a person within a
//  minute. It goes to the operator's own chat. Nothing is silenced, and when
//  mainnet is live this belongs in public again.
//
//  It does NOT post commits. Anyone who wants those has GitHub's Watch button,
//  and a stream of "fix X" messages tells a non-developer that a project is
//  unstable when the opposite is true.
//
//  WHERE IT POSTS
//  --------------
//  Telegram, Discord, or both -- whichever the config names. Every message is
//  written once in the neutral markup from lib/markup.js and rendered per
//  service on the way out, so the two channels can never drift apart in
//  content, and a message added later needs no work to reach both.
//
//  Discord is reached through a webhook rather than a bot token. A webhook can
//  post to one channel and do nothing else: it cannot read messages, list
//  members, or touch another channel. An announcement needs none of those, and
//  a credential that cannot do them cannot be made to.

 * at 07:51, 08:51, 09:51 and 09:52, hours after the routing was deployed and
 * while bots/test/routing.test.js reported six passes. The test called tick()
 * and checked the marking there -- it never reached this line. A test that
 * stops one layer above the bug proves the bug is absent, in the layer that
 * does not have it.
 *
 * It is exported so the test can exercise the composition rather than the
 * half of it that was already right.

    // is a TEST network whose entire hashrate is the founder's laptop and one

    // days. Publishing that 126 times does not inform anybody; it teaches a
    // reader that the project stops constantly, which is true of the test
    // chain and says nothing about the one that launches on 15 September.
    //
    // So the alert still fires, still every time, and still reaches a person
