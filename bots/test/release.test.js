// The release check silently did nothing for the only release that exists.
//
// GitHub's /repos/{repo}/releases/latest excludes pre-releases by design and
// answers 404 when every release is one. This project marks everything below
// 1.0 as a pre-release -- the release workflow does it automatically from the
// version string -- so that endpoint would have answered 404 for the entire
// pre-1.0 life of the project, and not one release would have been announced.
//
// The failure is invisible from the outside: a 404 there is indistinguishable
// from "no releases published yet", which is a legitimate state a bot must
// tolerate quietly. It was found by asking why lastReleaseTag was missing from
// the state file, not by anything going wrong.
