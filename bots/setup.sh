#
#  ABOUT THE CREDENTIALS
#  ---------------------
#  You paste them here, once, on your own machine. They are read with the
#  terminal echo off, so they do not appear on screen, do not reach
#  ~/.bash_history, and are never a command-line argument -- an argument is
#  visible in `ps` to every other process on the box.
#
#  They are written to a file only this bot's user can read, outside the
#  repository. Never put them in the repository: a secret inside a git working
#  tree is one `git add -A` away from being public, and no amount of care
#  prevents that reliably.
#
#  Nobody else ever needs to see them. Not a collaborator, not a support
#  channel, not an assistant helping you build this. A credential that only you
#  have seen cannot leak from anywhere else.
#
#  WHY DISCORD USES A WEBHOOK AND NOT THE BOT TOKEN
#  ------------------------------------------------
#  A webhook posts to exactly one channel. It cannot read a message, list your
#  members, remove anybody, or touch another channel. A bot token can do all of
#  those. Announcements need none of them, so the worst a leaked webhook can do
#  is post nonsense in one channel -- embarrassing, and undone in a minute by
#  deleting the webhook. A leaked bot token is the server.
#
#  Keep the bot you created for later, if you want slash commands. This is not
#  it and does not need it.
