#
#  WHY IT RUNS HERE AND NOT ON A SERVER
#
#  A monitoring page shows which service is down, which machine is short of
#  memory, what hour the backup runs and which node is behind. That is what
#  makes it useful, and it is also a map for anyone who wants to attack the
#  network: it names the weak machine and the unwatched hour.
#
#  Served from a server it needs a public address, a password, TLS, and it
#  becomes one more door into a machine that holds money. Run here it needs
#  none of those, because it is not on the internet at all. It binds to
#  127.0.0.1, which no other machine can reach -- not the café wifi, not the
#  router, not anyone.
#
#  WHAT IT MUST NEVER DO, AND DOES NOT
#
#  It runs read-only commands over the ssh key already on this machine. It
#  writes nothing to any server, stores no credential, and opens no port
#  beyond the loopback.
#
#  THE FOUR RULES AGAINST LYING
#
#  The founder put it plainly: "the report sometimes lies". A green panel
#  over a broken system is worse than no panel, because it buys calm that
#  was not earned. Three times in one day this project has had exactly that
#  -- a sweep reporting 21 passed while the backups had been dead for three
#  days; a version check going green because the outdated node happened to
#  be offline in that minute; two of my own measurements reporting the wrong
#  answer about something that was working.
#
#  So:
#
#    1. Every value carries the moment it was measured. Not "backups ok" but
#       "backups, 6h ago". A stale number shown as current is the ordinary
#       way a dashboard lies.
#    2. Unreachable is not healthy. When a host cannot be reached its panel
#       goes grey and says so, rather than holding the last good reading.
#    3. The page shows its own age. If the collector dies the page freezes,
#       and the age is what tells you rather than the stillness.
#    4. Nothing is inferred. What was not measured is not displayed.
#
#  It runs the same check scripts the sweep runs, rather than reimplementing
#  them, so that this page and the sweep cannot ever disagree about what is
#  true.

    The script goes in on STDIN, never as an argument.

    Passing it as the last argv element worked for as long as this ran under
    WSL. Moved to Windows Python it began timing out on both hosts at once:
    Windows has no argv, so subprocess rebuilds a single command line and
    escapes the double quotes inside the script. ssh delivered that to the
    remote shell, which saw an unbalanced quote and sat waiting for the rest
    of it until the 45-second limit expired -- and the panel then showed two
    healthy servers as unreachable.

    `bash -s` reads from stdin, so nothing quotes anything. This is the same
    fix, for the same reason, as the one made to check_reorg.py earlier the
    same day, where a script passed as an argument hit the kernel's 128 KiB
    limit. A script belongs on stdin.

    AND IT IS SENT AS BYTES, NOT AS TEXT.

    With text=True, Python opens that pipe in text mode, and on Windows text
    mode rewrites every \\n as \\r\\n. The remote bash then receives a shell
    script with Windows line endings and says:

        cut: '/proc/uptime'$'\\r': No such file or directory
        bash: syntax error near unexpected token $'do\\r'

    Half the sections came back empty and the rest of the script never ran.
    Encoding here and decoding the answer keeps the bytes the bytes, on any
    platform. Stripping the carriage returns afterwards would have been the
    patch; not letting the platform rewrite them is the fix.

    # ONE MISSED TIMEOUT IS NOT A DEAD MACHINE.

    # On 2026-09-24 the panel showed France "unreachable -- timed out after 60
    # seconds" while ssh from the same laptop answered in six, and the backup
    # check went red with it because it reaches all three hosts. The cause was
    # 70 MB being scp'd to that host at the same moment: its uplink and sshd
    # were busy, one connection went past the limit, and the panel called the

    # it has been wrong twice the operator stops believing the colour. So a
    # timeout or a transport error is retried once, briefly, before any verdict
    # is reached. A host that is genuinely down fails both times and costs a
    # few seconds; a host that was merely busy is reported as what it is.

    The dashboard now serves the page from Windows rather than from inside
    WSL, because a page bound to 127.0.0.1 inside the WSL virtual machine is
    not reliably reachable from the Windows browser -- on 2 September 2026 it
    was not reachable at all, by localhost or by the VM's own address, and the
    one tool whose job is to say when something is wrong was itself
    unreachable with nothing to announce it.

    But half of these checks are shell scripts, so the HTTP server runs
    natively and the shell checks are handed to a bash. Python checks run
    under the Windows interpreter directly.

    AND IT MUST BE THE OPERATOR'S BASH, NOT WSL.

    This used to say "Windows has no bash" and hand every shell check to
    `wsl -e bash`. It does have one: Git for Windows installs bash, and that
    is the bash a person gets when they run these checks by hand.

    The two are different machines. WSL is a separate Linux with its own
    filesystem and its own HOME -- /home/grgo, not /c/Users/gargo -- and
    therefore its own ~/.ssh. On 18 September that cost two panel entries:

        nodes agree                    unknown   13.140.33.187 could not be read
        deployed code is origin/main   unknown   13.140.33.187 could not be read

    while the same two checks run by hand from the operator's shell said
    "all 3 nodes agree" and "every deployed checkout is origin/main". The
    reason was one line out of ssh -v: WSL holds
    wam.coin.official@proton.me, the laptop shell holds gargo@r4x0uf-TUF,
    France and Singapore authorise both, and US-east -- added on 16
    September -- authorises only the second. So the panel had been reporting
    a healthy host as unreadable, permanently, for a reason no amount of
    looking at the host would ever reveal.

    A panel that disagrees with a hand-run of the same script is worse than
    no panel: it teaches the reader that yellow means nothing. So the shell
    checks now run in the same shell, with the same keys and the same
    known_hosts, as a person typing the command. WSL stays as a fallback for
    a machine with no Git bash, and the page says which one was used.

    """Is a copy of this panel already answering on the port?

    The scheduled task that owns this dashboard fires at logon and then every
    ten minutes, as a keep-alive: if the panel has died, the next trigger
    brings it back. But when it is alive and something else holds the port,
    every one of those triggers used to end like this --

        OSError: [WinError 10048] Only one usage of each socket address
            (protocol/network address/port) is normally permitted

    -- a console window flashing a Python traceback at the operator every ten
    minutes for a day. That happened on 7 September because I restarted the
    panel by hand instead of through its task, so my process held the port and
    the task's own copy could never bind.

    A traceback is the wrong answer to "something else is already doing this".
    It reads like a fault in the panel, and the fault is that there is nothing
    to do.

    THE GUARD IS NOT THE WHOLE FIX, AND IT RECURRED ON 18 SEPTEMBER.

    The message above is now polite and the exit code is 0, so nothing
    crashes. But the task is set to IgnoreNew: while it owns the port its own
    ten-minute trigger does nothing at all and no window ever appears. The
    moment somebody hand-starts this panel instead, the task has no instance
    of itself to ignore -- so every trigger launches a fresh py.exe, which
    finds the port taken, prints the polite line and exits, opening a console
    window in the operator's face every ten minutes. The task's Hidden flag
    does not suppress that window; it only hides the task in the UI.

    So the remedy belongs here next to the diagnosis, because a comment that
    describes a failure without naming the correct action is how the same
    person makes the same mistake twice:

        DO NOT start this by hand. To restart the panel on Windows:

            Get-NetTCPConnection -LocalPort 9787 -State Listen |
                ForEach-Object { Stop-Process -Id $_.OwningProcess -Force }
            Start-ScheduledTask -TaskName "WAM ops dashboard"

    The task must end up owning the port. Anything else leaves a window
    flashing every ten minutes until somebody notices.
