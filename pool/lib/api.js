// Redaction happens once, on the way out, and not endpoint by endpoint.
//
// Reported 2026-09-13 by an independent reviewer, and every line of it was
// true: /api/miners ran redactWorker() and its three siblings did not.
// /api/hashrate handed out `<payout address>.<rig label>` as the keys of its
// workers map, /api/blocks named the finding address of every retained block,
// and /api/payments returned full addresses beside their txids. One
// unauthenticated GET through pool.wamcoin.org returned the founder's own
// testnet address and the label he gave his machine.
//
// The control existed and was applied at one call site out of four. Worse,
// site/pool/index.html already told the world the addresses were truncated
// and that "nothing enumerates the others" -- a published claim ahead of the
// code, which is the one kind of defect this project treats as urgent.
//
// So the rule is structural now: identity fields are redacted where the
// response leaves the process, which is the only place that cannot be
// forgotten when a fifth endpoint is added.
//
// Two deliberate exemptions, both stated rather than implied:
//   /api/miner?address=X   the caller supplied X. It is a lookup, not an
//                          enumeration, and redacting it would break the one
//                          endpoint a miner uses to read his own figures.
//   labels after the dot   a rig name identifies nothing on the chain.
