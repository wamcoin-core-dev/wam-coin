# Where every listing request stands

Measured from the GitHub API on 2026-09-19, not recalled. Nine requests were
opened; this is what became of them and what, if anything, is owed.

| repo | # | state | what happened |
|---|---|---|---|
| satoshilabs/slips | 2051 | **merged** | coin type 5718349 and prefixes wam/twam/wamrt, 26 August |
| blocknetdx/blockchain-configuration-files | 197 | **open** | tryiou is folding it into a cleanup batch and said he will bump us |
| KomodoPlatform/coins | 21 | **open** | no comments at all since 29 August |
| GLEECBTC/coins | 1975 | **open** | **waiting on us** — see below |
| basicswap/basicswap | 701 | closed | "Mainnet is scheduled for 2026-09-15" — a deferral, not a refusal |
| bisq-network/bisq | 8030 | closed | he could not find the project — only the BEP-20 gaming token — and the ticker conflicts with it |
| haveno-dex/haveno | 2528 | closed | "We only consider coins with market traction / price" — the only market condition anyone set |
| bisq #8028, haveno #2527 | | closed | replaced by our own later PRs, no comments, not refusals |

## The one that is our fault

**GLEEC #1975.** cipig asked on 30 August: *"What about the 2 electrums? Do we
need to wait till 15.09.?"* He was told yes. 15.09 came, the servers moved to
mainnet, and nobody went back to him. Four days of an open request waiting on
a date that had already passed. `gleec-1975.txt` is the reply and it should go
first.

## The one worth reopening

**BasicSwap.** The closure had exactly one stated reason and it was the launch
date. Nothing was said about the coin, the code or the policy.
`basicswap-701-reopen.txt` reports that the condition is met and does not
argue with anything.

## Bisq: it was not a policy refusal, and this file said it was

Read whole rather than summarised, both of HenrikJannsen's comments turn on
one thing -- he could not find us.

> I do not see any project related to WAM but an existing coin
> [coingecko.com/en/coins/wam]. Bisq did not add new altcoins anymore, though
> with the BIP110 hardfork there might be case to reconsider that.
> -- 22 August

> I fear the request will not get support and as the ticker symbol conflicts
> thats another issue. As far I am aware the BIP110 Blake based fork coin
> will not have replay protection and therefor will not get added to Bisq as
> well as it would put users at risk. I will close that issue.
> -- 29 August

Three things this file got wrong on 19 September and are corrected here:

**"Bisq does not add new altcoins" was not the final word.** It is qualified
in the same sentence -- *"though with the BIP110 hardfork there might be case
to reconsider that"*.

**The objection that repeats in both comments is the identity collision.**
First he cannot find a project, only the BEP-20 gaming token; then the ticker
conflicts -- with that same token.

**And the flat "will not get added" is not about WAM at all.** It is about the
BIP110 Blake fork coin, a different project, refused for having no replay
protection. Attributing that sentence to us was a misreading.

What changed since 29 August is exactly the thing he could not find:

| | |
|---|---|
| a live chain | mainnet since 2026-09-15, height 3,307, 47 peers |
| an identity that is not the gaming token | SLIP-0044 coin type **5718349**, SLIP-0173 prefixes wam / twam / wamrt, merged 26 August |
| something to run | signed releases for Linux, Windows and macOS |
| something to check it with | a public explorer, and a concentration figure published whether it flatters us or not |

`bisq-new.txt` is written on that basis. It leads with what can be verified,
and it addresses the ticker head-on instead of hoping nobody mentions it --
because that part has not changed and pretending otherwise would be the
fastest way to deserve a third closure.

## The one that should NOT be reopened

**Haveno** closed #2528 with "we only consider coins with market traction /
price". Of every request this project has opened, that is the only one that
asked for a market, and WAM has none by design: this project does not pay for
listings, does not arrange a price, and says so in public. Reopening asks a
maintainer to make an exception to the single criterion he named, and the
answer would be the same.

(#2527 is not a refusal; it has no comments and was replaced by #2528 the
next day. The same is true of bisq #8028, replaced by #8030.)

It becomes worth revisiting when the reason itself changes -- a market that
exists because people want the coin, not because we arranged one.

## All six, ready. The founder picks the day.

A dormant request dies of silence, not of refusal. Three of these are open
and nobody has said no; two people are waiting on something that has already
happened, and one maintainer said he would call and has not yet. A short
message that the chain is live is what revives them.

Send in this order. Each stands alone -- skipping one does not break another.

| | file | where | why now |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | `gleec-1975.txt` | comment on the open PR | **overdue.** He asked whether to wait for 15.09 and nobody went back to him |
| 2 | `blockdx-197.txt` | comment on the open PR | the entry moved to v0.1.9, as promised in that thread in August |
| 3 | `komodo-21.txt` | comment on the open PR | open since 29 August with zero comments — give a reviewer a reason to look |
| 4 | `basicswap-701-reopen.txt` | **new** PR | closed for one reason, the launch date, and it has passed |
| 5 | `bisq-new.txt` | **new** PR | closed because he could not find the project; now he can |
| 6 | `haveno-2528.txt` | comment on the closed PR | asks for nothing. Send only if the record there is worth updating |

Every figure in all six was measured at 2026-09-19T18:30:44Z, except the
hashrate in the confirmation-depth paragraphs, measured 2026-09-20. **If they
are sent more than a day or two later, re-measure first** — height, peers and
the mined total move, and a stale number in a public thread costs more than it
saves. `scripts/check_post_text.py` must pass before any of them goes out.

**The hashrate figure needs more care than the others**, because it does not
drift, it swings: measured over the last five days it roughly doubles between
the quietest hour of the night and the busiest of the morning, and it halved
in a single day when machines were switched off. Quote it with the window it
was measured over, and quote the low end of the day rather than the peak —
the depths it justifies are set against the worst hour, not the best one.

**Why the confirmation paragraph is there at all.** `required_confirmations`
is 60 in our entry where most coins in those files carry 3, and
`Confirmations=60` in the Block DX conf where the default is 0. A reviewer
who finds an unusual number without an explanation assumes either a mistake
or something being hidden. Naming it first, with the reason and the promise
to lower it, turns the oddest value in the submission into the one that shows
the work was done.
