//  WHY THIS EXISTS, AND WHAT IT COST TO LEARN
//
//  On 2026-09-26 somebody put his machine on this chain, mined alone, and
//  solved height 7838 ninety-nine seconds after starting. The miner refused
//  to send the block:
//
//      error  could not submit the block: job 7838.9 is no longer held, so
//             the transactions it was built from are unknown.
//
//  Nothing was wrong with his node, his address, or his luck. The miner polls
//  getblocktemplate every five seconds, minted a fresh job id for every reply
//  whether or not anything had changed, and kept only the last EIGHT. Forty
//  seconds of memory, against a worker that holds one job until the tip moves
//  -- two minutes. Roughly two blocks in three could not be sent, on the one
//  feature the release was built for.
//
//  The unit test beside this one proves the comparison that decides when work
//  is new. This one proves the consequence against a real node: poll many
//  times with an idle mempool and the job must not change; mine a block and
//  the previous tip's job must still be submittable, because a block solved
//  against the tip that just moved is a competitor at the same height and has
//  won races before; mine another and the one before that may go.
//
//  It needs a node because the failure was never in the arithmetic. Every
//  step agreed with itself. It was in what the miner chose to forget.
