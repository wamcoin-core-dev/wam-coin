#      bash miner/build.sh
#
#  One translation unit, one g++ invocation, one static library. No autotools,
#  no cmake, no package manager. Somebody who has just downloaded the source
#  should be able to read this script in full before running it.
#
#  Environment:
#      RANDOMX_INCLUDE   default ~/wam/build/randomx/src
#      RANDOMX_LIB       default ~/wam/build/randomx/build/librandomx.a
#      CXX               default g++
#      OUT               default miner/wam-miner
#      LDFLAGS           default empty
#      LDLIBS            default -lpthread
#      RUN_SELF_TEST     default 1; set 0 when cross-compiling
#
#  CROSS-COMPILING
#
#  scripts/build_windows.sh drives this script with the mingw compiler to
#  produce wam-miner.exe, which is why LDFLAGS, LDLIBS and RUN_SELF_TEST are
#  knobs rather than constants: Windows needs -lws2_32 for sockets, a static
#  link so the result is one file somebody can double-click, and it cannot run
#  its own self-test on the Linux machine that built it.
#
#  Skipping that self-test is only acceptable because it is not skipped: the
#  platform-build workflow runs --self-test on a real Windows runner, and the
#  SHA-256, byte-order, target and RandomX vectors all have to pass there
#  before the binary is packaged. A cross-built miner whose RandomX disagreed
#  would hash all day and find nothing.
