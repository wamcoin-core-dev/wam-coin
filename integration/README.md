# Integration files, prepared in advance

Everything a venue needs from us, written out before it is asked for, so that
answering a listing enquiry is copying a file rather than starting work.

Each subdirectory holds what that venue actually consumes. Five of the six take
a pull request rather than a web form; the sixth, Maya, is not a listing at all
but a chain client inside their node.

| Venue | What it consumes | Ready |
|---|---|---|
| [Komodo Wallet](komodo/) | PR to `GLEECBTC/coins`: coin entry, electrum servers, explorer, icon | **gone with the account** — was [#1975](https://github.com/GLEECBTC/coins/pull/1975), sent 2026-08-30, open until 2026-09-24. [#21](https://github.com/KomodoPlatform/coins/pull/21) went to a dead mirror first — see [SUBMIT.md](komodo/SUBMIT.md) |
| [Block DX](blockdx/) | PR to `blocknetdx/blockchain-configuration-files`: 2 confs + manifest | **gone with the account** — was [#197](https://github.com/blocknetdx/blockchain-configuration-files/pull/197), open and being worked on. The entry now carries v0.1.10 |
| [Haveno](haveno/) | PR to `haveno-dex/haveno`: asset class, test, service entry | gone with the account — was [#2528](https://github.com/haveno-dex/haveno/pull/2528), closed, needs a market price first |
| [BasicSwap DEX](basicswap/) | PR to `basicswap/basicswap`: a Python interface package | gone with the account — was [#701](https://github.com/basicswap/basicswap/pull/701), closed with *"mainnet is scheduled for 2026-09-15"*, resubmit after |
| [Bisq](bisq/) | PR to `bisq-network/bisq`: asset class, test, service entry | gone with the account — was [#8030](https://github.com/bisq-network/bisq/pull/8030), **closed on a mistaken identity**, corrected and resent |
| [Maya Protocol](maya/) | a node chain client in Go, not a listing | months, and theirs to want |

And one that is not a venue at all but blocks three of them:

| Registry | What it consumes | Ready |
|---|---|---|
| [SLIP-0044 and SLIP-0173](slips/) | one table row each, to `satoshilabs/slips` | **merged 2026-08-26** [#2051](https://github.com/satoshilabs/slips/pull/2051) — coin type 5718349, prefixes `wam` / `twam` / `wamrt` |

## Where this actually stands, 2026-08-30

Enquiries were sent 2026-08-18 and all six venues replied within hours, every
one of them pointing at a GitHub repository: listings are made by pull
request, not by application.

Since then, six submissions and one merge. Every refusal has been about
policy or timing; **not one has been about the code**:

- **SatoshiLabs merged ours.** They are the only party that examined the
  parameters themselves, and coin type 5718349 with prefixes `wam` / `twam`
  / `wamrt` is now in the registry every hardware wallet derives from.
- **Bisq closed ours on a mistaken identity, and it has been corrected and
  resent.** They found the *other* WAM — the gaming token — and answered that
  they do not add a **second fork of a coin they already list**, and that they
  could not find ours. That is not the same sentence as "we add no new
  altcoins", and this file said the second one for a week.

  It is the search problem arriving somewhere it costs money. Searching
  `wamcoin` returns a gaming token, a Nigerian dairy and a Maldivian waste
  company before it returns this project; `wamcoin.org` is not in the first
  three pages. That was a marketing annoyance until a reviewer deciding
  whether to list the coin looked it up, found somebody else's, and closed
  the request. Every future submission should name the genesis hash and the
  repository in its first paragraph, because the coin's own name is not
  currently enough to identify it.
- **Haveno** answered *"we only consider coins with market traction /
  price"* — a sequencing rule. They are where a coin arrives, not where it
  starts.
- **BasicSwap** closed with *"mainnet is scheduled for 2026-09-15"*.
  Resubmit after that date.
- **Block DX** is open and a maintainer is preparing a batch that includes
  it, and intends to test the wallet in docker.
- **Komodo** is open at
  [GLEECBTC/coins#1975](https://github.com/GLEECBTC/coins/pull/1975), sent
  2026-08-30 — two hours after #1974 was merged into that same repository.
  It went first to `KomodoPlatform/coins`, which is what Komodo's own
  documentation names and which is a dead mirror: last commit 2025-12-05,
  pull requests open since February, and its final commit a merge *from*
  GLEECBTC. [#21](https://github.com/KomodoPlatform/coins/pull/21) is left
  open there — it costs nothing, and it is where their documentation
  points. See [komodo/SUBMIT.md](komodo/SUBMIT.md).

Two mistakes worth writing down rather than learning twice.

**The order was wrong.** Komodo is the venue a coin starts at and it was
submitted last, while three venues that gate on a market price were
approached first. A wallet asks whether the entry is correct; an exchange
asks whether anyone is trading it. Only one of those can be answered before
launch.

**And twice now a submission has gone to a fork nobody reads.** BasicSwap
went to `tecnovert/basicswap#2`; Komodo went to `KomodoPlatform/coins#21`.
Both were caught by the founder, and both times from the same evidence: a
pull request number far lower than an active repository would hand out. #2
and #21, against #701, #2528, #8030 and #2051 everywhere else. Before
submitting anywhere, check the repository's last commit date and its newest
pull request number — a registry of 782 coins whose newest PR is #21 is not
being read by anyone.

## The Electrum server, which was the one thing missing

Komodo Wallet requires **ElectrumX servers with valid SSL** for a UTXO coin —
it is a directory in their repository, not an optional field.

**Two run**, at `electrum.wamcoin.org` and `electrum2.wamcoin.org`, on
deliberately different providers — two servers at one provider are one
outage. Both were verified from a machine other than themselves: valid
certificate, protocol answers, and a genesis hash matching what the node
reports. `integration/electrumx/` builds one from nothing.

Since 2026-08-29 there is one instance per network — `wam-electrumx@testnet`
and `wam-electrumx@mainnet`, each with its own env file, database and ports.
Before that a single instance served whichever network it was installed for,
and running the installer for mainnet on launch night would have overwritten
the testnet configuration in place.

Testnet now answers on **51001/51002/51004**. The mainnet numbers —
50001/50002/50004, which are what `komodo/electrums-WAM.json` publishes — are
held empty until 15 September, and the mainnet instances are installed on
both hosts and deliberately not started. A testnet server answering on a
mainnet port is worse than silence: a reviewer who connects, gets a working
server, and reads back a genesis hash that is not the one in the entry has
found a defect in the submission.

None of this ever blocked the other two: BasicSwap and Block DX run the daemon
directly and never speak the Electrum protocol.

Light wallets reading a balance without downloading the chain is worth having
whether or not any venue asks for it.

## The gap that closed, and the one that stayed

**SLIP-44 coin type — granted.** This section used to say WAM had none and
that `komodo/coin-entry.json` could not carry a `derivation_path` until a
number was assigned. SatoshiLabs merged
[#2051](https://github.com/satoshilabs/slips/pull/2051) on 2026-08-26: coin
type **5718349** (`0x57414D`, "WAM" in ASCII), and SLIP-0173 prefixes `wam`,
`twam`, `wamrt`. The entry carries `m/44'/5718349'` and
`scripts/check_listing_entry.py` compares it against the constant in
`src/wam/wam-params.h` on every sweep.

It is worth being precise about what that is and is not. It is the number
every wallet derives addresses from, and no hardware wallet can support a
coin without one. It is **not** Trezor firmware support: that is a separate
registry, `trezor-firmware/common/defs/bitcoin/`, and WAM is not in it.

**Message signing prefix.** Fixed here rather than left: WAM used Bitcoin's
`"Bitcoin Signed Message:\n"`, which meant a signature proving control of a WAM
address doubled as proof of control of the corresponding Bitcoin address. It is
now `"WAM Coin Signed Message:\n"` — see `WAM-021` in
`scripts/patch_upstream.py`. Changed before launch because afterwards it would
invalidate every signature already produced.

---

## Keeping these honest

The parameters here are duplicated from `src/wam/wam-params.h` and
`src/wam/chainparams.cpp`. `scripts/audit_repo.sh` checks that the values in
this directory still match the source, for the same reason the vesting schedule
is checked in three files: a listing config that disagrees with the chain is an
integration that fails on the first connection, and the venue does not come
back to ask why.
