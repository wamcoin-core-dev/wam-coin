# Komodo Wallet — what a submission needs

> **MERGED AND LIVE since 2026-09-22.** WAM is in `GLEECBTC/coins` and trades
> on dex.gleec.com. It did not get there by our pull request. `cipig`, that
> repository's maintainer, wrote on 2026-09-21 that he had to fix conflicts
> so he opened one of his own — [#2034](https://github.com/GLEECBTC/coins/pull/2034)
> — ran a test swap himself, changed one field, and merged it on 2026-09-22.
> Because that pull request was his and not ours, it survived our GitHub
> account being suspended on 2026-09-24 while all five of ours vanished.
>
> **He lowered `required_confirmations` from 60 to 15, and he was right.**
> 60 confirmations at a 120 second target is a two hour swap, and the backend
> cannot hold one open that long: 60 did not mean a safer swap, it meant no
> swap at all. His test at 4 confirmations completed in ten minutes. 15 is
> about thirty minutes, and he said it can be raised later if swaps start
> failing.
>
> **What it costs, stated rather than glossed:** the window in which a swap
> could be undone by a party able to rewrite the chain falls from two hours to
> thirty minutes. That number is set by hashrate, and this network's is small.
> It is a real exposure and it is accepted knowingly, for the one reason that
> the alternative is a listing nobody can trade on.
>
> **The deposit depth this project publishes stays 60.** It is a different
> question with a different answer: a deposit can wait two hours and an
> atomic swap cannot. Do not let the two numbers be "unified" by anybody
> tidying up.
>
> **Still wrong in the live entry:** its `links.github` points at
> `wam-coin-official`, which is locked. One line, and it is the smallest
> honest reason to go back to that repository.

A pull request to [`KomodoPlatform/coins`](https://github.com/KomodoPlatform/coins),
not a web form. Four things go in, and all four are ready.

Only one thing still blocks the submission, and it is not one of them: these
files describe mainnet, and mainnet opens on 15 September 2026. Everything
that could be built before that day now is.

| | Where | State |
|---|---|---|
| Coin entry | appended to `coins` | [`coin-entry.json`](coin-entry.json) |
| Icon, 200×200 PNG | `icons/wam.png` | `brand/png/wam-platform-200.png` |
| Explorer | `explorers/WAM` | `https://explorer.wamcoin.org` |
| Electrum servers | `electrums/WAM` | [`electrums-WAM.json`](electrums-WAM.json) — see below |

They also ask for contact details for service alerts, since a listed coin whose
infrastructure goes quiet is their support problem as much as ours.

## Every field, and where it comes from

Each value below is duplicated from the consensus source. If they disagree, the
source wins and this file is wrong.

| Field | Value | Source |
|---|---|---|
| `rpcport` | 9554 | `WAM_MAINNET_RPC_PORT` — peer port **minus** one |
| `pubtype` | 73 | `base58Prefixes[PUBKEY_ADDRESS]`, addresses start `W` |
| `p2shtype` | 135 | `base58Prefixes[SCRIPT_ADDRESS]`, start `w` |
| `wiftype` | 190 | `base58Prefixes[SECRET_KEY]`, keys start `V` |
| `bech32_hrp` | `wam` | `bech32_hrp` |
| `segwit` | true | active from height 1 |
| `avg_blocktime` | 120 | `WAM_POW_TARGET_SPACING` |
| `sign_message_prefix` | `WAM Coin Signed Message:\n` | `MESSAGE_MAGIC`, changed by `WAM-021` |

**`required_confirmations` is 60**, which is two hours at a two-minute
target. It was 6 until 2026-08-29, with a note saying 6 gave "a comparable
reorg cost on this chain's timing". That was wrong, and wrong in the
direction that costs somebody money.

The cost of reversing a confirmation is set by hashrate, not by block
timing. Six confirmations on a chain with a millionth of Bitcoin's hashrate
cost a millionth as much to reverse; making the blocks faster or slower does
not change that. WAM is a new RandomX chain, which means the hardware that
would attack it is CPU — the most rentable resource there is, by the hour,
from every cloud provider. Monero is safe at ten confirmations because its
hashrate is enormous. A chain in its first weeks is not Monero.

20 is not an invented number. Of the coins already in this registry, 3 is
the most common value (475 of them) and 20 is the second (122). The majors
sit at the bottom — BTC 1, LTC 2, DOGE 2, DASH 2, RVN 3, ZEC 3 — because
their chains are settled. Putting WAM at 20 says, in the registry's own
vocabulary, that this chain is new and is being treated as new.

This field governs when Komodo Wallet shows a received payment as spendable
to its owner. It is not exchange deposit policy, which should be far more
conservative while hashrate is low — see the security section of
`docs/LISTING_PACKAGE.md`.

## The derivation path, and the one field still absent

**`derivation_path` is `m/44'/5718349'`.** It was blank until 2026-08-20 for a
good reason and is filled now for a better one: `wamd` derives there. A wallet
reports `44h/5718349h`, `49h/5718349h`, `84h/5718349h` and `86h/5718349h`, so
the field describes the software Komodo would be talking to rather than
requesting something of it.

`5718349` is `0x57414D`, which is `WAM` in ASCII — the convention Wanchain used
one number above at `0x57414E`. It is declared once, in
`src/wam/wam-params.h`, and `scripts/audit_repo.sh` rejects any file here that
disagrees with it.

**Registration is granted.** SatoshiLabs merged
[PR #2051](https://github.com/satoshilabs/slips/pull/2051) into master on
2026-08-26: SLIP-0044 coin type `5718349`, and SLIP-0173 prefixes `wam`,
`twam`, `wamrt`. The number in this file is no longer a request. It was
worth waiting for -- had they assigned a different one, every wallet built
in the meantime would have been discarded, which costs nothing before
mainnet and everything after.

**`trezor_coin` stays absent, and the SLIP registration did not change that.**

It is easy to read the merge of PR #2051 as hardware wallet support arriving,
and it is not. SLIP-0044 is a numbering registry; Trezor's own coin support
lives in a different one, `common/defs/bitcoin/` in `trezor/trezor-firmware`,
which holds 59 definitions and none of them is WAM. Checked on 2026-08-27
rather than assumed.

The registration is a prerequisite for that submission, not a substitute for
it. Writing a name into this field now would tell Komodo Wallet that a
Trezor can hold WAM, and it cannot.

## Electrum servers

Komodo Wallet requires ElectrumX servers with valid SSL for a UTXO coin. Their
repository has an `electrums/` directory and a UTXO coin without an entry there
is not usable by the wallet — it has no way to read balances.

**Both now run**, on deliberately different providers, and both were verified
from outside the machines rather than on them — `scripts/check_electrum.py`
speaks the protocol, compares the height each one claims against the node over
ssh, and probes every A record behind a name separately:

```
electrum.wamcoin.org    169.58.159.165:50002 SSL   height 537, ElectrumX 2.0.0
                        169.58.159.165:50001 TCP   height 537
electrum2.wamcoin.org     5.223.52.200:50002 SSL   height 537, ElectrumX 2.0.0
                          5.223.52.200:50001 TCP   height 537
```

`electrum` is at Contabo and `electrum2` at Hetzner. Two servers on one
provider are one outage, which is the failure Komodo's support desk absorbs.
50004 carries the Electrum protocol over WebSocket for Komodo's *web* wallet
and is open on both; desktop and mobile use 50002 directly.

### 2026-08-29: those ports now hold nothing, on purpose

The heights above were a **testnet** chain, answering on the ports this
entry publishes for **mainnet**. That is worse than an endpoint being down.
A reviewer who connects to `electrum.wamcoin.org:50002`, gets a working
ElectrumX, and reads back a genesis hash that is not the one in this entry
has found a defect in the submission — where a port that is not up yet is
just a launch date.

So testnet's ElectrumX moved to **51001 / 51002 / 51004** on both hosts, its
index carried across rather than rebuilt, and 50001 / 50002 / 50004 are held
empty until mainnet opens on 2026-09-15. `wam-electrumx@mainnet` is already
installed on both machines, configured against those ports, and deliberately
not started.

Until 15 September the endpoints in `electrums-WAM.json` do not answer, and
the pull request says so rather than leaving it to be discovered.

Getting there found two faults worth recording, neither of which any check
would have reported:

**The first server was down for 39 hours.** Stopped during the testnet reset on
2026-08-20 and never restarted. `systemctl` showed `inactive` with
`Result=success`, so nothing looked wrong, and `sweep.sh` ran in that window
and reported 14 passed — because no check had ever asked. `check_electrum.py`
exists for that reason and is now in the sweep.

**`electrum.wamcoin.org` resolved to two addresses** and only one had ever run
the service, so half of all connections failed even while the server was up.
Any check that resolved the name once and got lucky would have passed.

**One thing is still not true.** They serve testnet, and Komodo lists mainnet.
The same installer with `--network mainnet` produces the mainnet server and
nothing else about either host changes — so on launch day this is a restart,
not a build under time pressure.

The two venues ranked most likely to fit — BasicSwap and Block DX — run `wamd`
itself and never speak the Electrum protocol, so neither was ever blocked by
any of this.
