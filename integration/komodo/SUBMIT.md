# Submitting WAM to the Komodo coins registry

## Which repository — this took two attempts

**`GLEECBTC/coins`.** Komodo's own documentation points at
`KomodoPlatform/coins`, and [#21](https://github.com/KomodoPlatform/coins/pull/21)
was sent there on 2026-08-29. That repository is a dead mirror:

| | KomodoPlatform/coins | GLEECBTC/coins |
|---|---|---|
| last commit | 2025-12-05 | daily, by a bot |
| newest PR | #21 (ours) | #1974 |
| stars / watchers | 0 / 1 | 27 / 7 |
| open PRs | since February, unmerged | merged within days |

Its last commit was *"Merge pull request #1627 from GLEECBTC"* — it was a
downstream mirror and the sync stopped nine months ago.

Blockzero settles it. The same author submitted to both:
GLEEC [#1934](https://github.com/GLEECBTC/coins/pull/1934) on 15 August,
merged in two days; KomodoPlatform #19 on 13 August, still open seventeen
days later. `cipig` and `shamardy` — Komodo's own people — work in GLEEC.

**The pull request number was the tell**, and the founder saw it before I
did: #21 against a registry of 782 coins is not a number an active
repository hands out. It is the same mistake as BasicSwap, where
`tecnovert/basicswap#2` was a personal fork nobody read.

`make_submission.sh` builds against GLEECBTC by default. Set
`WAM_COINS_REPO` to override.

Everything below was checked against `KomodoPlatform/coins` at master on
2026-08-29: the four paths exist, the icon size matches theirs, and no `WAM`
is present in any of them.

This is the first venue in the order that matters, and the reason is worth
stating once. Bisq closed ours on a mistaken identity -- they found the gaming token
also called WAM and said they do not add a second fork of a coin they
already list; it has been corrected and resent. Haveno answered *"we only
consider coins with market traction / price"*, which is a sequencing rule
rather than a judgement — they are where a coin arrives, not where it
starts. BasicSwap said *"mainnet is scheduled for 2026-09-15"* and closed,
which is the same answer in a different accent.

Komodo is the other kind of venue. Their registry carries more than seven
hundred coins, most of them far smaller than anything with a market, and
what they check is whether the entry is correct — not whether anyone is
trading it yet. A coin gets a price by being somewhere first, and this is
that somewhere.

## The four files

| Goes to | From here | What it is |
|---|---|---|
| `coins` | `coin-entry.json` | one object appended to the array |
| `electrums/WAM` | `electrums-WAM.json` | the two Electrum servers |
| `explorers/WAM` | `explorers-WAM.json` | the block explorer |
| `icons/wam.png` | `../../brand/png/wam-platform-128.png` | 128×128, lower case, as theirs are |

`coins` is one large JSON array. The entry is appended to it — the file is
not replaced.

## Every field was checked against the source it describes

Run before submitting, and again if anything in `src/wam` moves:

```bash
python3 scripts/check_listing_entry.py
```

At the last run: eleven fields, zero mismatches, no field missing that
comparable entries carry. `pubtype` 73, `p2shtype` 135, `wiftype` 190 and
`bech32_hrp` `wam` come from `chainparams.cpp`; `avg_blocktime` 120 from
`wam-params.h`; `derivation_path` `m/44'/5718349'` from the coin type
SatoshiLabs assigned.

A listing entry is read by software, not by a person. A wrong `pubtype` does
not look wrong — it sends somebody's coins nowhere.

## The one thing that must be said in the pull request

**The Electrum endpoints do not answer yet, and will not until 15
September.** `electrum.wamcoin.org:50002` and `:50004` are held empty on
purpose: until 29 August a *testnet* ElectrumX was answering there, which is
worse than silence — a reviewer who connects, gets a working server, and
reads back a genesis hash that is not the one in this entry has found a
defect in the submission. Testnet moved to 51001/51002/51004 and the mainnet
instance is installed on both machines, configured, and deliberately not
started.

Saying it in the pull request costs nothing. Having it found costs the
submission.

## The pull request

**Title**

```
Add WAM Coin (WAM)
```

**Body**

```
WAM Coin is a standalone layer 1 — a Bitcoin Core v28.1 fork with RandomX
proof of work — not a token on another chain. Mainnet opens 2026-09-15.

Registered with SatoshiLabs, merged into satoshilabs/slips master on
26 August:

  SLIP-0044  coin type 5718349
  SLIP-0173  bech32 prefixes wam / twam / wamrt

  https://github.com/satoshilabs/slips/blob/master/slip-0044.md
  https://github.com/satoshilabs/slips/blob/master/slip-0173.md

Note: there is an unrelated WAM on CoinGecko — a BEP-20 gaming token on BNB
Chain. BEP-20 tokens sit under BNB's coin type rather than holding one of
their own, so there is no collision in SLIP-0044, which lists WAM against
WAM Coin.

Files added:

  coins           the WAM entry
  electrums/WAM   two servers, deliberately on different providers
                  (Contabo and Hetzner) — two servers at one provider are
                  one outage
  explorers/WAM   https://explorer.wamcoin.org/
  icons/wam.png   128x128

Every field in the entry is derived from source rather than transcribed:
pubtype 73, p2shtype 135, wiftype 190 and bech32_hrp wam from
src/wam/chainparams.cpp; avg_blocktime 120 from src/wam/wam-params.h;
derivation_path m/44'/5718349' from the registered coin type.

required_confirmations is 60 rather than the 3 most entries use. WAM is a
new RandomX chain, and the cost of reversing a confirmation is set by
hashrate, not by block timing — so a young chain deserves a larger number
and we would rather ask for it than have a user find out why.

One thing to flag before you test it: the Electrum endpoints do not answer
until 15 September. 50002 and 50004 are held empty until mainnet opens.
Until 29 August a testnet server was answering on them, which would have
reported a genesis hash that does not match this entry, so it was moved to
51001/51002/51004 instead. The mainnet instances are installed on both hosts
and start on launch day.

Consensus rule worth knowing about, since it affects a block's outputs: 5%
of every block subsidy goes to a treasury address, enforced by every node,
until block 400,000. A block that omits it is rejected. Miners receive 47.5
WAM per block until that height and 50 after it.

Source, and everything above is checkable in it:
https://gitlab.com/WAMCoin/wam-coin

Happy to supply a node, a testnet endpoint, or anything else that helps the
review.

## After it is open

Record the pull request number in `NOTES.md`, the way #2051 is recorded for
the SLIP registration. A submission nobody wrote down is a submission
somebody re-sends.
