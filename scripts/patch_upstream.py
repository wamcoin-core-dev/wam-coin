 patch_upstream.py -- turn a stock Bitcoin Core tree into the WAM Coin node
===============================================================================

WHY THIS IS NOT A SET OF .patch FILES
-------------------------------------
A unified diff is pinned to line numbers and surrounding context. The moment
upstream touches a nearby line the patch fails, and the usual response -- bump
the fuzz factor until it applies -- is exactly how a consensus change silently
lands in the wrong function. For a codebase whose bugs cost real money that
trade is not acceptable.

Instead every change below is an anchored transformation:

    * `anchor`  a string that must appear EXACTLY ONCE in the target file.
                Zero matches or two matches is a hard error, never a guess.
    * `apply`   the edit.
    * `verify`  a predicate re-checked after the edit.
    * idempotent: re-running is a no-op, so a half-finished build can simply
                be resumed.

Anything unexpected aborts the whole run and leaves the tree untouched, because
a partially patched consensus layer is far more dangerous than an unpatched one.

The rename that gave Linux ~/.wam changed one line of GetDefaultDataDir and left the other two branches of the same function alone, which is exactly why it went unnoticed -- the source reads as done.\\n\\nIt was found in the published binaries, not in the source, and it destroys nothing: a node opened on another chain's directory prints 'Incorrect or no genesis block found. Wrong datadir for network?' and shuts down before writing. That was measured on a throwaway chain rather than assumed. What it costs is every user on those platforms who also runs Bitcoin Core -- their WAM node refuses to start, and the message does not mention -datadir.\\n\\nrename_binaries.py now names the folder WAM on all three platforms. That moves the default, so this change exists for the other half of the problem: a node that upgrades finds an empty directory, and a wallet that is perfectly safe looks lost. It warns and names both paths.\\n\\nIt does not move or adopt anything. A folder called Bitcoin may belong to Bitcoin Core, and a node that guesses wrong about somebody else's wallet is worse than one that says where to look. The warning fires only when that folder contains a wam.conf, which Bitcoin Core never writes.\\n\\nNot consensus. It changes no block and no rule."),
