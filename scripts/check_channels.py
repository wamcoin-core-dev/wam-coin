"""Does the canonical channel list actually name everything that is ours?

    python3 scripts/check_channels.py
    python3 scripts/check_channels.py --offline    # skip the reachability pass

WHY THIS EXISTS

CHANNELS.txt has one job: tell a reader which accounts and hosts are ours,
so that everything else claiming to be WAM can be dismissed. A channel that
is ours and missing from the file does not merely go unlisted -- the file
says "There are no others", so the omission actively brands our own
property an impostor's, and hands anyone who wants to discredit it a
quotation from our own repository.

That has now happened twice.

  Revision 2, 21 August   the explorer, the pool and the Electrum server
                          were live and unlisted
  Revision 3, 4 September the BitcoinTalk announcement thread, up since
                          14 August -- three days after revision 1 -- and
                          the contact address published in SECURITY.md

Revision 2's own note explains the failure exactly, and it happened again a
fortnight later, because the fix was a person remembering and the person did
not. This is the check that does the remembering.

WHAT IT ENFORCES

  1. The two copies -- CHANNELS.txt and site/CHANNELS.txt -- are identical.
     They drifted for a fortnight: the repository root sat at revision 1
     while the site served revision 2, so "the canonical list" named two
     different sets of channels depending on where you read it.

  2. Every URL and address the project publishes about ITSELF, anywhere in
     the documentation, appears in the list. This is the direction that
     catches the real bug: something becomes ours, gets written about, and
     never reaches the file.

  3. Every listed channel resolves. A dead entry in an anti-impersonation
     list is worse than no entry, because a squatter can take the name.

WHAT IT CANNOT CATCH, SAID PLAINLY

It would NOT have caught the BitcoinTalk omission it was written for.

The thread URL appeared nowhere in this repository -- that is precisely why
nobody noticed it for three weeks -- and rule 2 can only compare the list
against what the repository already says somewhere else. A channel that
exists solely in the founder's browser is invisible to any script.

So this catches the case where a channel is written about but unlisted (the
explorer, the pool and the Electrum server, August 21), and the case where
the two copies drift (which had already happened, silently, for a
fortnight). The remaining case -- a channel created and never written down
at all -- has no automated answer, and pretending otherwise would be worse
than the gap. The answer to that one is a habit: a channel is not created
until it is in this file.

Exit 0 all good, 1 something is wrong, 2 the check could not run.
