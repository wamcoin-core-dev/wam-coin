# ===========================================================================
#
#  WAM Coin is a fork, not a rewrite. Roughly 250,000 lines of peer-to-peer
#  networking, script interpretation, UTXO management and wallet code are
#  inherited from Bitcoin Core -- code that has been adversarially reviewed for
#  fifteen years. Retyping it would not make WAM more original, it would make
#  it less safe.
#
#  What this repository owns is the ~2,000 lines that actually make WAM
#  different: the emission schedule, the treasury rule, DarkGravityWave and
#  RandomX. Those live in src/wam/ and are applied on top by
#  scripts/patch_upstream.py.
#
#  The upstream tag is PINNED. Never track a branch: a consensus layer that
#  changes underneath you between two builds is not a consensus layer.

# inherited whatever the build machine's CPU could do. On 2026-08-20 that
# produced a published release carrying 746 AVX-512 instructions -- GitHub's
# runner has AVX-512 -- and it died with SIGILL on an AMD EPYC that does not:
#
#     wamd.service: Main process exited, code=dumped, status=4/ILL
#
# Every other shipped program was clean, because only the node links RandomX.
# Anyone downloading that release on a CPU older than the builder's got a node
# that crashed, which on launch day is most of the miners the coin is for.
#
# Nothing is lost by lowering it: RandomX detects AES-NI and the rest at
# RUNTIME and takes the fast path when the CPU has it. ARCH only decides what
# the compiler may assume unconditionally, which for a binary other people run
# must be the baseline.
#
# WAM_RANDOMX_ARCH=native is available for a local build that will never leave
# the machine. Releases must never set it -- scripts/check_isa_baseline.sh
# refuses to package a binary that carries instructions above the baseline,
# so a slip fails loudly instead of being discovered by a stranger's crash.

# RE-RUNNING ON AN ALREADY-PATCHED TREE IS NOT SAFE, AND THIS LINE USED TO

#
# It read "the patcher is idempotent". Most of its edits are: each carries a
# marker describing what it produces, finds the marker, and reports "already
# applied". But a marker that describes the OUTPUT is version-specific on
# purpose -- v0.1.1 shipped reporting /WAM:0.1.0/ because a marker named the
# family instead of the result, and that lesson is written into
# patch_upstream.py. The consequence is that a tree patched at one WAM
# version cannot be re-patched at a later one: the marker for the new version
# is absent and the upstream anchor is gone too, so the patcher aborts
# part-way.
#
# On 18 September that cost an hour. France's tree was patched at 0.1.0 in
# August; re-running it for 0.1.9 stopped at configure.ac with
#
#     anchor for 'version 28.1.0 -> 0.1.8' not found
#
# and left the tree partially patched -- which is the one state you must not
# build from.
#
# The release CI clones upstream fresh on every run, so no published binary
# has ever been affected, and the patcher is deliberately left alone: it is
# the machinery behind every release and its version markers are correct.
# What was wrong was this sentence.

# beside it. Every check passed, because the symlink works.
#
# It is not cosmetic. A WAM node and a Bitcoin node cannot coexist on one
# machine when both install /usr/local/bin/bitcoind, and package_release.sh
# looks for src/wamd, which never existed.
#
# Run here rather than in patch_upstream.py because it rewrites automake
# variable names, which the anchored-transformation model is deliberately not
# built for -- it renames identifiers across a file rather than replacing a
# known string at a known anchor.
