#  solo_gate.sh -- does the miner we ship still deliver a block it solves?
# ===========================================================================
#
#      bash scripts/solo_gate.sh [dir-with-wamd-wam-cli-wam-miner]
#
#  WHY THIS EXISTS, AND WHY IT RUNS BY ITSELF
#
#  v0.1.10 was announced on every channel as the release that lets anybody
#  mine alone. The next morning the first person who tried it solved a real
#  block ninety-nine seconds in, and the miner threw it away: the job he had
#  been hashing had scrolled out of a list bounded by count while he was
#  still on it. Roughly two blocks in three were unsendable.
#
#  Nothing caught it, and the reason is exact. The build gate runs --check,
#  which builds a block and asks the node whether it WOULD be accepted. It
#  proves construction. It cannot prove delivery, and delivery was what broke.
#
#  test_platform_solo.sh has proved delivery since v0.1.10 -- mine two blocks
#  for real and require the node to accept both -- but it was run by hand, on
#  the day somebody remembered. A check that depends on being remembered is
#  not a guard. This is that script on a timer, against the binaries that are
#  actually installed, on hardware this project owns, so that a regression is
#  found by us within a day instead of by a miner losing money.
#
#  IT IS DELIBERATELY NOT RUN IN CI. Mining on a hosted build service is
#  against the terms of every one of them, and this project lost its
#  code-hosting account on 2026-09-24 finding that out.
#
#  WHAT IT LEAVES BEHIND
#
#  On failure, an ALARM file in the directory the ops panel already counts,
#  and a non-zero exit so systemd records the failure and wam-alert@ fires.
#  On success it removes its own alarm, because an alarm nobody clears is an
#  alarm everybody learns to ignore.

# WHICH BINARIES. The ones we publish -- not the ones installed here.
#
# The first run of this gate pointed at /opt/wam-current-bin and failed with
# "unknown option '--solo'". That was true: this project's own servers run
# binaries older than the feature, deliberately, because upgrading a node
# that is serving the chain buys nothing and restarts the pool. So the gate
# was asking a question about a build nobody downloads.
#
# What has to keep working is what a stranger fetches from wamcoin.org. So
# that is what is fetched -- once per version, into a cache -- and its
# signature is checked against the published key before a single byte of it
# is run. A gate that runs unverified binaries to prove they are good has
# already lost the argument it exists to win.
#
# Pass a directory as $1 to override, for testing a local build by hand.

# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
# TWO QUESTIONS, BECAUSE ONE OF THEM WOULD HAVE MISSED WHAT HAPPENED.
#
# test_platform_solo.sh mines two real blocks and requires the node to accept
# both. It is the end-to-end proof, and it would NOT have caught the defect
# of 2026-09-26: on regtest a block is solved in under a second, so the job
# never grows old enough to be forgotten. A gate that cannot fail on the bug
# it was written for is decoration.
#
# So the job bookkeeping is proved separately and deterministically, against a
# real node but without hashing: poll many times with nothing happening and
# the job must survive; move the tip and the job behind it must still be
# submittable. That is the failure, reproduced in a second, every day.
