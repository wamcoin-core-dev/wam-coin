#
#  WHY THIS EXISTS
#
#  A listing entry is read by software, not by a person. A wrong `pubtype`
#  does not look wrong on the page -- it sends somebody's coins nowhere, and
#  the first report of it is a user who has already lost them.
#
#  The entry was written by hand from the source, and hand-written copies of
#  constants drift. Every one of these numbers already exists exactly once in
#  src/wam, so the entry can be checked against it rather than trusted, and
#  the check can run in the sweep rather than at submission time -- because
#  the dangerous moment is not the day it is written, it is the day somebody
#  changes a prefix and forgets that a file in integration/ repeats it.
