#  It asks GitHub what the release actually carries, downloads SHA256SUMS and
#  its signature, and verifies them against the fingerprint in SECURITY.md.
#
#  WHY IT ASKS GITHUB AND NOT THE WORKING TREE
#
#  Everything else here can be true while the published release is not. The
#  signing key can be present, package_release.sh can sign correctly, the
#  local files can verify perfectly -- and the asset uploaded to GitHub two
#  weeks ago can still be the unsigned one, because uploading is a manual
#  step and manual steps get half-done.
#
#  What a stranger downloads is the only thing that matters, so that is what
#  this reads.
