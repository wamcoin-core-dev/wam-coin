#  It asks GitHub what the release actually carries, downloads SHA256SUMS and
#  its signature, and verifies them against the fingerprint in SECURITY.md.
#
#  WHY IT ASKS GITHUB AND NOT THE WORKING TREE
#
#  Everything else here can be true while the published release is not. The
#  signing key can be present, package_release.sh can sign correctly, the
#  local files can verify perfectly -- and the asset uploaded to GitHub two
#  weeks ago can still be the unsigned one, because uploading is a manual
#  step and manual steps get half-done.
#
#  What a stranger downloads is the only thing that matters, so that is what
#  this reads.

# WHERE THE DOWNLOADS ARE, WHICH IS NOT GITHUB ANY MORE.
#
# This asked api.github.com, and on 2026-09-26 the sweep reported "could not
# check" twice: sixty unauthenticated calls an hour is the whole budget, and
# a sweep spends them. So the one check that proves a stranger can verify our
# release was silenced by somebody else's rate limit.
#
# Every post, every page and CHANNELS.txt send people to wamcoin.org for the
# downloads. That is served from machines this project owns, it has no rate
# limit, and it is where the person this check speaks for will actually go.
# GitHub is one of three mirrors of the SOURCE; it is not where a wallet is
# fetched from, and a check must ask the place the reader will go.
