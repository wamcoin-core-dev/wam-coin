#
#  WHY THIS EXISTS
#
#  This is the operation performed more often than any other here, and until
#  now it was a line typed by hand into a throwaway script:
#
#      git -C /opt/wam fetch -q origin && git -C /opt/wam reset -q --hard origin/main
#
#  On 2 September 2026 that line failed on France with "could not read
#  Username for 'https://github.com'" -- git's unhelpful way of saying the ref
#  listing came back malformed. GitHub was having a bad few minutes; the same
#  command worked perfectly a quarter of an hour later.
#
#  The failure was not the problem. The problem was that the && chain stopped
#  there, the script printed "4fb9fda -> 4fb9fda", and that reads as "nothing
#  to do" rather than "this did not happen". France stayed two commits behind
#  and the only thing that noticed was check_deployed_code.sh going red on the
#  panel an hour later -- which is the safety net working, and is not a
#  substitute for the deploy telling the truth at the time.
#
#  So: retries, because the failure is transient. And the commit is READ BACK
#  from each host afterwards and compared, because a deploy that reports
#  success without checking is a deploy that will one day be wrong quietly.

# DEPLOYING IS PUBLISHING NOW, AND IT DID NOT USE TO BE. nginx serves
# /opt/wam/site straight from this checkout -- see deploy/nginx/
# wam-site-locations.conf -- so the moment a host is updated, whatever
# CHANNELS.txt this commit holds is live at wamcoin.org/CHANNELS.txt. While
# the site was published from a separate branch, "deploying is not
# publishing" was true and was written down as a rule. It stopped being true
# when the site moved onto our own hardware and nobody rewrote the rule.
#
# The file tells its reader to run `gpg --verify CHANNELS.txt.asc
# CHANNELS.txt`. Publishing revision N beside revision N-1's signature hands
# that reader BAD signature -- and BAD signature is the one outcome that
# reads as an attack. He cannot tell our carelessness from somebody having
# replaced the list that says which accounts are ours. That is worse than
# having no signature at all, which is why this refuses rather than warns.
