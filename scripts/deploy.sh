#
#  WHY THIS EXISTS
#
#  This is the operation performed more often than any other here, and until
#  now it was a line typed by hand into a throwaway script:
#
#      git -C /opt/wam fetch -q origin && git -C /opt/wam reset -q --hard origin/main
#
#  On 2 September 2026 that line failed on France with "could not read
#  Username for 'https://github.com'" -- git's unhelpful way of saying the ref
#  listing came back malformed. GitHub was having a bad few minutes; the same
#  command worked perfectly a quarter of an hour later.
#
#  The failure was not the problem. The problem was that the && chain stopped
#  there, the script printed "4fb9fda -> 4fb9fda", and that reads as "nothing
#  to do" rather than "this did not happen". France stayed two commits behind
#  and the only thing that noticed was check_deployed_code.sh going red on the
#  panel an hour later -- which is the safety net working, and is not a
#  substitute for the deploy telling the truth at the time.
#
#  So: retries, because the failure is transient. And the commit is READ BACK
#  from each host afterwards and compared, because a deploy that reports
#  success without checking is a deploy that will one day be wrong quietly.
# ===========================================================================
