#
#  Installed at /usr/local/bin/wam-facts on every host and named as a forced
#  command in the reporting key's authorized_keys line:
#
#      restrict,command="/usr/local/bin/wam-facts" ssh-ed25519 AAAA... report
#
#  With that in place the key cannot open a shell, cannot forward a port,
#  cannot run anything else, and cannot be talked into it -- ssh ignores
#  whatever command the client asks for and runs this instead. If the
#  machine that holds the key is ever taken, what the attacker gains here is
#  the ability to read a status line they could mostly infer anyway.
#
#  It prints facts. It changes nothing, reads no key material, and touches
#  no wallet.

# So whatever backup timers the machine has are what gets reported. The
