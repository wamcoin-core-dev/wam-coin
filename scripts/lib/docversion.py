#  docversion.py -- what counts as "the reader is told to download this"
# ===========================================================================
#
#  Imported by scripts/set_version.py, which rewrites those versions, and by
#  scripts/check_docs_version.py, which audits them.
#
#  WHY IT EXISTS
#
#  set_version.py's own header said it: "These are the same contexts
#  check_docs_version.py checks, deliberately: the writer and the auditor must
#  agree on what counts as an instruction." They were written to agree and
#  then kept separately, which is not agreement, it is coincidence with a
#  deadline.
#
#  On 5 September 2026 set_version.py was changed to discover its documents
#  instead of keeping a list of three, because docs/MINE.md had arrived with
#  nine download commands in it and the list could not see it. The auditor was
#  not changed. So afterwards:
#
#      written but not audited : deploy/systemd/laptop/README.md, docs/MINE.md
#      audited but not written : site/index.html
#
#  -- and site/index.html contains no download instruction at all, while the
#  three pages that do (site/start/, site/start-ar/, site/mine/) were in
#  neither list. The auditor was reading a page that could not fail and
#  skipping every page that could, and it printed
#
#      ok    every documented version is one that exists
#
#  which was true of what it read and meaningless about the site.
#
#  A hand-kept list of files goes stale the moment somebody adds a page. That
#  had already been established twice -- once in set_version.py, once in
#  CHANNELS.txt, where "four accounts" survived into a fifth. This is the
#  third, so the list stops being kept by hand anywhere.

# A version number is only an instruction when the reader is being told to
# fetch that exact thing. Every other mention is prose, and prose about old
# versions is usually the most important prose in the file:
#
#     "a node left on v0.1.4 will reject every valid block on launch day
#      and fork itself off the network"
#
# That sentence must survive every release untouched. An early version of the
# auditor matched every vX.Y.Z and reported it as a dead download link -- a
# check that objects to correct text teaches its reader to skip the output,
# and on 2026-08-19 three faults were live at once behind exactly that habit.
#
# So the contexts are named one by one, here, once. Each is written as the
# text before the version and the text after it, and both the rewriting form
# and the searching form are built from the same pair -- so the writer cannot
# move a version the auditor is not looking at, or the other way round.

    # They were on a release page until 2026-09-24 and are on wamcoin.org
    # now. Only the first shape was listed here, so raising the version
    # rewrote the FILENAME in every command and left the DIRECTORY behind:
    #
    #   https://wamcoin.org/downloads/v0.1.9/wam-coin-v0.1.10-...tar.gz
    #
    # Every download instruction in every document, pointing at a directory
    # for one release and a file from another. Neither half is wrong on its
    # own, which is why it would have survived a quick read.

# WHICH OF THOSE CONTEXTS CAN ONLY EVER BE OUR OWN SOFTWARE.
#
# The first three can be nothing else: releases/download/v... and
# /downloads/v... are URLs into this project's own downloads, and
# wam-coin-v... / wam-miner-v... are the names of files only this project
# publishes. The third, "[v0.1.5](", is a markdown link whose
# label happens to be a version -- and docs/ links to Bitcoin Core v28.1 and
# RandomX v1.2.1 exactly that way.
#
# check_docs_version.py needed the distinction and did not have it. Given a
# version it could not find among this repository's releases it skipped the
# line as third-party, with the comment "Not one of ours: Bitcoin Core v28.1,
# RandomX v1.2.1". True of the third context; wrong for the first two, where
# an unpublished version means the documents tell a newcomer to curl a file
# that does not exist. So the question in that file's own title -- "do the
# instructions name a release that exists?" -- returned ok on 18 September
# for documents naming v0.1.9 the moment before v0.1.9 existed.
#
# Split here rather than in the caller, because set_version.py rewrites all
# three contexts and must go on doing so: a link labelled with our version
# still has to move when the version moves.

# Prose that quotes an old version ON PURPOSE, and must survive every release.
#
# The contexts above are narrow but they cannot read intent. On 5 September
# set_version.py rewrote this line in deploy/systemd/laptop/README.md:
#
#     ExecStart=/home/grgo/wam-v0.1.4/wam-coin-v0.1.4/bin/wamd
#
# into `.../wam-v0.1.4/wam-coin-v0.1.7/bin/wamd` -- a path that has never
# existed and never can. The paragraph above it says "The first version of
# wam-node.service named the release directly", so the whole point of the
# quote is that it names v0.1.4. Worse, it half-rewrote: the outer directory
# does not match `wam-(?:coin|miner)-v` and stayed, so the example became
# incoherent rather than merely wrong, and the next reader has to work out
# which half is a typo.
#
# set_version.py's own header promises exactly this will not happen: "Prose
# that names an old version on purpose ... must survive every release
# unchanged." A regular expression cannot tell an instruction from a
# quotation, so the author says which, in the file, where it can be seen:
#
#     <!-- wam:quote-begin -->
#         ExecStart=/home/grgo/wam-v0.1.4/wam-coin-v0.1.4/bin/wamd
#     <!-- wam:quote-end -->
#
# The auditor honours the same marks, from this same module, or it would
# report a quoted v0.1.4 as a dead download link -- a check objecting to
# correct text, which is how people learn to ignore checks.
#
# The marks are the project-wide ones in scripts/lib/quoted.py, not a
# convention private to this module. This exact fault appeared in three
# unrelated checks within one day, and three private conventions is how it
# appears in a fourth.
