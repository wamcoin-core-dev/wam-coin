#  check_release_matches.sh -- is the published download this network?
# ===========================================================================
#
#      bash scripts/check_release_matches.sh            # inspect the binary
#      bash scripts/check_release_matches.sh --source   # tag source only
#
#  WHY THIS EXISTS
#
#  v0.1.0 was tagged and published on 2026-08-15. Over the three days after
#  that, the founder reserve was locked, all three genesis blocks were
#  re-mined, and the treasury was given its own address. The published tarball
#  was never rebuilt. It stayed on the download page describing a different
#  network:
#
#      published mainnet genesis  bbbd737e...    source  d8d3debe...
#      published testnet genesis  b6668514...    source  ce81c20a...
#      published regtest genesis  1fa171c2...    source  b88f3d26...
#
#  A node from that tarball cannot connect to this network at all -- not a
#  version disagreement, a different chain. Someone downloaded it and mined
#  2,208 blocks on a history nobody else shares before anyone noticed.
#
#  WHAT IT CHECKS, AND WHY THAT WAY
#
#  Not the tag. The tag says what someone intended to build; it cannot say
#  what the artifact actually contains, and today's whole lesson is that those
#  differ. So this downloads the published binary and looks inside it for the
#  genesis hashes and treasury addresses that chainparams.cpp declares right
#  now. Those constants appear verbatim in the binary's read-only data, so
#  finding them needs no execution of a downloaded file.
#
#  --source additionally diffs the tagged tree against HEAD, which explains a
#  failure but can never substitute for looking at the artifact.
