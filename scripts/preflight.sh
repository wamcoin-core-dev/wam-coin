#  preflight.sh -- is this actually ready to launch?
# ===========================================================================
#
#      bash scripts/preflight.sh                     # local checks only
#      bash scripts/preflight.sh --host IP           # also check a server
#      bash scripts/preflight.sh --nodes "IP1 IP2"   # also compare nodes
#                                                     against each other
#
#  WHY THIS EXISTS
#
#  Every "full system check" up to now reported that things were running, and
#  running is not the same as correct. `systemctl is-active wamd` said active
#  while the executable was still called bitcoind and wamd was a symlink
#  beside it. A check that asks "is the service up" cannot see that.
#
#  So this asks the questions whose answers only appear when you try to use
#  the thing: can a release be packaged, is the binary named ours, does the
#  config the node reads exist under our name, would a stranger's first
#  command work. Each check names what breaks if it fails, because a red line
#  with no consequence attached gets ignored.
#
#  It is meant to fail. Items 1 and 2 below cannot pass before the key
#  ceremony, and that is correct -- they are the gate, not a defect.
