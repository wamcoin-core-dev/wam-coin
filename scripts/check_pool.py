#  check_pool.py -- does the pool give miners work, and does it pay them?
# ===========================================================================
#
#      python3 scripts/check_pool.py --node HOST [--api URL] [--stratum HOST]
#
#  WHY THIS EXISTS
#
#  On 2026-08-21 this pool had found 150 blocks, owed 16,176 WAM to two
#  miners, and had paid exactly nothing since the chain started. Every ten
#  minutes since genesis its payout had failed with "Fee estimation failed.
#  Fallbackfee is disabled", and nothing anywhere said so. The pool page was
#  green, the service was active, the stratum ports were open, miners were
#  connected and submitting shares, and blocks were being found.
#
#  It was discovered by a human opening the pool's own web page while doing
#  something unrelated. sweep.sh had been run that morning and reported
#  14 passed.
#
#  A pool that accepts work and never pays is worse than a pool that is down.
#  A miner notices a pool that is down in seconds; this one takes days to
#  notice, and by then the electricity is spent.
#
#  WHAT IS CHECKED, AND WHY EACH ONE
#
#    the API answers               a pool nobody can query is a pool nobody
#                                  can audit
#    it sees the same chain        pool height against the node's, so a pool
#                                  stuck on a fork is not reported healthy
#    the subsidy split is the      minerSubsidy + treasurySubsidy must equal
#    consensus one                 blockSubsidy, and the treasury share must
#                                  be what the consensus rule enforces. A
#                                  pool that disagrees with the chain about
#                                  the money is paying from a number it
#                                  invented.
#    every stratum port issues     not "is the port open" -- it subscribes,
#    real work                     authorises, and waits for a mining.notify.
#                                  A port that accepts connections and never
#                                  sends a job is a port where miners burn
#                                  electricity for nothing.
#    the RandomX seed matches      the seed height the pool hands out must
#    the chain                     match the epoch the chain is in, or every
#                                  share computed against it is invalid
#    PAYOUTS ARE ALIVE             blocks matured and nobody paid is a
#                                  failure. Owed above the payout threshold
#                                  with payments stopped is a failure. This
#                                  is the check that was missing.
#
#  Exit 0 only if all of it holds. Nothing checked is a failure, not a pass.
