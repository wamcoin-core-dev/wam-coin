#
#  WHY THIS EXISTS
#
#  Until 3 September 2026 the releases carried SHA256SUMS and nothing else.
#  A checksum file hosted beside the file it describes proves only that both
#  came from the same place: whoever can replace the binary can replace the
#  list, and the two will agree perfectly. It protects against a corrupted
#  download. It does not protect against anybody.
#
#  A signature is what cannot be produced without the key, and the key is not
#  on any machine this project exposes to the internet.
#
#  WHY IT IS A SCRIPT AND NOT THREE LINES IN A README
#
#  The three commands are easy to run and easy to run wrongly. `gpg --verify`
#  exits 0 on a good signature made by a key you have never seen; it also
#  prints a WARNING that reads alarming and is normal. `sha256sum -c` on a
#  file list that does not mention your download prints nothing and exits 0.
#  Someone checking a download for the first time should not have to know
#  either of those.
#
#  This refuses to print ok unless all three hold: the signature is good, it
#  was made by the fingerprint published in SECURITY.md, and the file in front
#  of you is the file that fingerprint signed for.

# Where this script itself lives, resolved to an absolute path BEFORE the cd
# below. The order is the whole point.

# $0 is whatever the caller typed, and the caller is not standing in the repo:
# the command published in the announcement is
#
#     git clone https://github.com/wamcoin-core-dev/wam-coin
#     bash wam-coin/scripts/verify_release.sh ~/Downloads
#
# so $0 is the relative path `wam-coin/scripts/verify_release.sh`. Resolving it
# after `cd "$DIR"` resolves it against ~/Downloads, where no such path exists,
# so SIGNING-KEY.asc beside it is never found, the fallback to the reader's own
# keyring is taken, and a reader who has imported nothing is told
#
#     FAIL  the signature over SHA256SUMS is NOT valid
#
# about a release that is perfectly good. That is the worst failure this script
# has: it accuses an honest release, at the exact moment someone is deciding
# whether to trust us, and it does it to every first-time reader.
#
# It was invisible because it only happens when the caller is OUTSIDE the repo.
# Every test run was `bash scripts/verify_release.sh <dir>` from the repo root,
# where dirname $0 is `scripts` and the fallback path happens to resolve. Found
# on 4 September 2026 by running the published command as a stranger would, on
# a clean directory, with an empty keyring.
