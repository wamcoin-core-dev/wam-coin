#      wam-miner-<version>-x86_64-linux-gnu.tar.gz  the reference miner

#
#  PORTABILITY IS THE WHOLE POINT
#  ------------------------------
#  The development build uses `-march=native`, which compiles for exactly the
#  CPU doing the building. That is right for a machine that mines for itself
#  and catastrophic for a release: a binary built on a 2024 laptop with AVX-512
#  dies with SIGILL on anything older, and the miner who downloaded it has no
#  idea why. RandomX is built the same way by default (ARCH=native).
#
#  So the release build compiles RandomX and the miner again, from scratch,
#  against the plain x86-64 baseline. Nothing is lost by this: RandomX detects
#  AES, AVX2 and the rest at *runtime* through randomx_get_flags(), so a
#  generic binary still uses every instruction the host actually has.
#
#  WHAT THIS IS NOT
#  ----------------
#  These are not reproducible builds. Two people running this script will get
#  binaries that differ, and the checksums below prove only that a download
#  arrived intact -- not that it corresponds to this source. Reproducibility
#  needs a pinned toolchain (Guix, as Bitcoin Core does), and until that exists
#  the release notes say so rather than implying a guarantee nobody can check.

WAM Coin $VERSION -- $PLATFORM
=====================================================================

RUN A NODE IN FOUR COMMANDS
---------------------------

  1.  Check what you downloaded is what we built:

          sha256sum --ignore-missing -c SHA256SUMS

      --ignore-missing matters: SHA256SUMS lists both packages, and
      without it a person who took only the node is told the miner
      FAILED and, following this instruction, deletes a good file.

      Every line must say OK. If one does not, delete that file and
      download it again -- do not run it.

  2.  Make sure the two libraries are present. On Ubuntu or Debian:

          sudo apt-get install -y libevent-2.1-7t64 libsqlite3-0

      On Ubuntu 22.04 the first is named libevent-2.1-7 instead. That is
      all this needs; there is no third package.

  3.  Start the node on the test network:

          ./bin/wamd -testnet -daemon

      It finds the network by itself through DNS. Give it a minute.

  4.  Ask it how it is doing:

          ./bin/wam-cli -testnet getblockchaininfo
          ./bin/wam-cli -testnet getsupplyinfo

That is a full node. It validates every block for itself and trusts
nobody, including us.


TO MINE
-------

  Download the miner package beside this one, then:

      ./wam-miner -o stratum+tcp://pool.wamcoin.org:3333 \\
                  -u YOUR_WAM_ADDRESS.rig1

  Get an address first:

      ./bin/wam-cli -testnet createwallet mine
      ./bin/wam-cli -testnet getnewaddress

  TESTNET COINS ARE WORTH NOTHING. They do not carry over to mainnet on
  15 September 2026. This is for testing the software, and that is all.


WHAT IS IN HERE
---------------
  bin/wamd         the node
  bin/wam-cli      talk to a running node$GUI_LINE
  bin/wam-tx       build and inspect raw transactions
  bin/wam-util     miscellaneous utilities
  bin/wam-wallet   wallet maintenance, offline

  DEPENDENCIES.txt what this needs installed, and how to check
  WHITEPAPER.md    the design and its limits
  SECURITY.md      how to report a vulnerability


CHECK OUR CLAIMS RATHER THAN BELIEVING THEM
-------------------------------------------

  ./bin/wam-cli -testnet getsupplyinfo     what the chain says about its money
  ./bin/wam-cli -testnet getdevfeeinfo     the 5% treasury and when it ends
  ./bin/wam-cli -testnet getrandomxinfo    the proof-of-work key schedule

  From the source tree, "$PY" scripts/verify_supply.py replays all 33
  halvings with exact integer arithmetic and asserts the 22,000,000 cap,
  and "$PY" scripts/patch_upstream.py --list prints every difference
  from Bitcoin Core with the reason for each.


THE FINE PRINT, WHICH IS THE IMPORTANT PART
-------------------------------------------

  These binaries are built for the plain x86-64 baseline and run on any
  64-bit Intel or AMD processor.

  They are NOT reproducible builds. The checksums prove your download
  arrived intact; they do not prove it was compiled from this source.
  If that distinction matters to you -- and for a currency it should --
  build it yourself. README.md has the steps and it takes about twenty
  minutes.

  There has been no third-party security audit.

WAM Coin $VERSION -- what this needs to run
===========================================

Measured from this exact binary, not assumed:

    glibc     $REQ_GLIBC or newer
    libstdc++  GLIBCXX_$REQ_GLIBCXX or newer  (GCC 12 and up)

That is Ubuntu 22.04 LTS or newer, Debian 12 or newer, and anything of a
similar age. If your system is older than that, build from source -- no flag
on this binary will make it start.

If the node exits with

    error while loading shared libraries: ...

install the shared libraries it asks for:

    sudo apt-get install -y libevent-2.1-7t64 libsqlite3-0

On Ubuntu 22.04 the libevent package is named libevent-2.1-7 instead.

Nothing else is required. This build has ZMQ disabled, which is why it does
not ask for libzmq, libsodium, libpgm, libnorm or Kerberos -- none of which
this project uses.

Verify what your copy actually wants:

    ldd bin/wamd | grep 'not found'

Empty output means the libraries are present. To check the versions too:

    ldd bin/wamd >/dev/null && echo ok

Anything about GLIBCXX or GLIBC there means your system is older than this
build; use a newer one or build from source.
