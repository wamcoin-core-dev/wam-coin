#
#  WHY THIS EXISTS
#
#  Upgrading was a sequence somebody remembered: download, untar, move three
#  symlinks, restart. Every step of it has failed at least once on this
#  project.
#
#    - the pool server was mining with a binary compiled in the git checkout
#      on 13 August -- software nobody could download and no checksum
#      described -- because "just build it here" is one command shorter
#    - the founder's node came back on 0.1.3 hours after being upgraded,
#      because the restart replayed a shell command from weeks earlier
#    - a release was deployed once without its checksum being checked at all
#
#  So it is written down, it verifies before it unpacks, and it says what it
#  did. On 15 September this same command upgrades mainnet, and that is not
#  the morning to be recalling the steps.
#
#  WHAT IT WILL NOT DO
#
#  Build anything. What runs on our machines has to be the bytes a stranger
#  downloads, or a bug we see is a bug only we have -- and worse, a bug they
#  see is one we cannot reproduce.
