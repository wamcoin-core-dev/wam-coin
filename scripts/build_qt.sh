#  build_qt.sh -- reconfigure the tree with the Qt GUI and build it
# ===========================================================================
#
#      bash scripts/build_qt.sh
#
#  The tree is normally configured with --without-gui, because the node, the
#  pool and the miner need nothing from Qt and the GUI roughly doubles the
#  build. This turns it on.
#
#  Prerequisites (one apt-get, needs root):
#      qtbase5-dev qttools5-dev qttools5-dev-tools libqrencode-dev
#
#  Re-running ./configure invalidates every object file, so this is a full
#  rebuild. On 24 cores expect twenty minutes or so.
