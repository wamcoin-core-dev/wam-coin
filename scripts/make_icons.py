#  make_icons.py -- build the Windows .ico and macOS .icns from the brand mark
# ===========================================================================
#
#      python3 scripts/make_icons.py            # write brand/generated/
#      python3 scripts/make_icons.py --check    # verify they exist and match
#
#  WHY THIS EXISTS
#
#  patch_upstream.py replaced exactly one of the GUI's icon files:
#
#      brand/generated/wam-icon-1024.png  ->  src/qt/res/icons/bitcoin.png
#
#  and src/Makefile.qt.include ships three more that it did not touch:
#
#      qt/res/icons/bitcoin.ico           the Windows taskbar and .exe icon
#      qt/res/icons/bitcoin_testnet.ico   the same, for a testnet node
#      qt/res/icons/bitcoin.icns          the macOS application bundle
#
#  So every Windows and macOS build this project has published carried
#  Bitcoin's B on the window, the taskbar, the dock and the executable itself
#  -- on a wallet holding somebody's coins, which is the one place a wrong
#  logo is not cosmetic. A user who checks that he is running what he thinks
#  he is running has been shown the wrong answer since v0.1.8.
#
#  The mark is generated rather than committed as a binary blob nobody can
#  diff, and --check is what stops the two drifting apart again.
#
#  THE TESTNET VARIANT
#
#  Upstream distinguishes testnet by hue, so that a person cannot confuse the
#  window holding real money with the one holding none. That distinction is
#  worth more than brand purity, so the testnet icon is the same mark rotated
#  in hue -- recognisably WAM, unmistakably not mainnet.
