#
#  WHY THIS EXISTS
#
#  The checks in this directory were each written after something went wrong,
#  and each of them works. On 2026-08-19 three faults were nevertheless live
#  at the same time:
#
#    - the published v0.1.0 download was a different network entirely, four
#      days after the genesis blocks were re-mined
#    - the two deployed nodes ran different consensus binaries and the chain
#      had been split for six hours
#    - the Electrum server was unreachable from the internet, and so was the
#      mainnet p2p port, which would have failed silently on launch day
#
#  None of them was subtle. All of them would have been caught in under a
#  minute. They survived because running the checks depended on remembering
#  to run the checks, one at a time, and nothing listed what had not been run.
#
#  So this is one command, and its most important column is the one that says
#  SKIPPED. A check that was not run is not a check that passed, and the
#  summary refuses to let those look alike.
#
#  Run it at the start of a working session and before anything is announced.

# green for a chain with nothing on it, three days into one that had 2,384
# blocks and real coins.
