# ===========================================================================
#
#      python3 scripts/check_first_impression.py
#
#  WHY THIS EXISTS
#
#  On 2026-08-22 a Bisq maintainer read a submission for this coin and
#  replied:
#
#      "I do not see any project related to WAM but an existing coin."
#
#  The links were in the pull request. The project was real, the chain was
#  running, five venues had submissions open. But the GitHub repository had
#  an empty homepage field, no topics at all, and a description that read
#  "a digital currency ecosystem designed for economic liquidity and global
#  trading" -- a sentence containing not one term anybody searches for. The
#  website had no preview card, so every link shared anywhere rendered as a
#  bare URL. And the web search for the project's own name returned an
#  unrelated BEP-20 gaming token that owns the ticker.
#
#  None of that was found by a check. It was found because the founder asked
#  the same question twice.
#
#  The lesson is not "look more carefully next time". It is that how a
#  project appears to someone who has never heard of it is a property of the
#  project, and properties get checked. Five submissions had already gone out
#  to five venues before anyone looked at the front page they pointed at.
#
#  WHAT IS CHECKED
#
#    the repository        description carries terms a person would search
#                          for, homepage points at the site, topics exist
#    the website           title, description, canonical, and the Open Graph
#                          and Twitter tags without which a shared link is a
#                          bare URL with no title, no summary and no mark
#    the published links   every URL the site and CHANNELS.txt advertise
#                          actually resolves, because a dead link on the page
#                          that asks for trust costs more than a missing one
#
#  This needs no credentials: everything here is what an outsider can see.
