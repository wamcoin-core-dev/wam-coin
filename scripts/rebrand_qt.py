Replace Bitcoin's user-visible wording in the Qt GUI with WAM's.

    python3 scripts/rebrand_qt.py --tree build/wam-core [--check]

WHY THIS IS A SCRIPT AND NOT A PATCH SET
----------------------------------------
Everywhere else in this project, upstream is modified through anchored
transformations in patch_upstream.py: one edit, one anchor, one reason. That
works because those edits are surgical.

This is not surgical. There are roughly ninety occurrences of "Bitcoin" in the
GUI's user-visible text, spread across twelve .ui files and a dozen sources,
and every one of them says the same thing for the same reason. Ninety anchors
would be ninety chances to drift out of date with upstream, to guard a change
nobody needs to read individually.

WHAT IT DOES NOT TOUCH
----------------------
Only text a user can read is rewritten:

  * the contents of <string> elements in .ui files
  * the contents of tr("...") and QT_TRANSLATE_NOOP("...", "...")
  * the BIP21 URI scheme, which must not stay "bitcoin:" -- a WAM payment QR
    code that a Bitcoin wallet offers to pay is a way to lose money

Identifiers keep their names. BitcoinUnits, BitcoinGUI, BitcoinAddressValidator
and the rest stay exactly as upstream wrote them, because renaming a class
changes no one's experience and guarantees a painful merge at the next release.
Comments are left alone for the same reason.

The script is idempotent: running it twice changes nothing the second time,
which is what lets the build call it unconditionally.

    # dialog told him the program would download "the full Bitcoin block chain
    # (4 GB) starting with the earliest transactions in 2009", and warned that
    # the sync "is very demanding and may expose hardware problems". WAM's
    # chain is about five megabytes and eleven days old, and syncs in four
    # minutes.
    #
    # The chain's name is handled by the phrase table above. These two are
    # not text substitutions: the year is a number in the source, and the

# The content class is [^<]*, not .*?, and that is the whole safety argument.

# pattern treats one of those as an opening tag and then runs to the *next*
# </string>, swallowing every element in between -- which on the first attempt
# rewrote <header>qt/bitcoinamountfield.h</header> into wamamountfield.h and a
# widget named openBitcoinConfButton into openWAMConfButton. The build stopped,
# which was lucky; a rename that still compiled would have been worse.
#
# Forbidding '<' in the content makes crossing an element boundary impossible:
# a self-closing tag simply finds no match.
