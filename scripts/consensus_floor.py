#  consensus_floor.py -- the oldest release a node may run and still be valid
# ===========================================================================
#
#      python3 scripts/consensus_floor.py
#      python3 scripts/consensus_floor.py --explain
#
#  WHY THIS EXISTS
#
#  check_peer_versions.py asked whether every independent operator was on the
#  newest release, and warned that anyone older "will reject every valid
#  block and fork off at height 1".
#
#  That was true when the newest release was the one that changed consensus.
#  It stopped being true the moment v0.1.6 shipped -- a miner fix that
#  touches no consensus rule -- and within an hour of upgrading our own nodes
#  the check was telling us that a node on v0.1.5 would be thrown off the
#  network. v0.1.5 is correct and will stay correct.
#
#  A launch-critical warning that cries wolf is worse than none. The next
#  person to read it is an operator who did exactly the right thing and is
#  being told it was not enough.
#
#  HOW THE ANSWER IS FOUND
#
#  Not from a constant somebody has to remember to bump -- this project has
#  been bitten three separate times by one fact living in two places. It is
#  derived from the repository:
#
#    for each tag, newest first, read the consensus values out of
#    src/wam/chainparams.cpp and src/wam/wam-params.h at that tag; the floor
#    is the newest tag whose values differ from the tag before it.
#
#  Comments, whitespace and anything that is not a consensus value are
#  stripped first, so reformatting a file or rewriting a comment cannot move
#  the floor. Only the values can.

# The test at the head of CHAINPARAMS_PATTERNS is the definition: "a node

# field assigned through `consensus.` fails that test.
#
# nMinimumChainWork is the least total work a header chain must carry before a
# node will begin to trust it -- an anti-DoS policy, so that a fresh node
# cannot be walked onto a cheap fabricated history by the first peer it meets.
# Two nodes with different values accept identical blocks. It cannot put them
# on different chains. What it can do is stop a node syncing at all, which is
# a liveness question, and scripts/check_min_chain_work.py exists for it.
#
# Counting it here is not harmless. v0.1.8 set the testnet value -- leaving
# mainnet at zero -- and that moved this floor to v0.1.8, which made
# release.yml refuse to publish a release whose tag carried no MANDATORY line.
# The two remedies available at that moment were both wrong: write a MANDATORY
# line, and every channel is told UPDATE REQUIRED for a release no node needs
# -- spending the one warning that has to be believed on launch day, which is
# precisely the failure release.yml's own comments describe; or do not publish.
#
# A v0.1.7 node has zero there, follows this chain exactly as before, and
# accepts every block a v0.1.8 node accepts. It is not on a different chain,
# so v0.1.8 is not a floor.
