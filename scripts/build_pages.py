#
#  WHY THIS EXISTS
#
#  Everything worth reading about WAM lived at addresses nobody says out loud:
#
#      github.com/wam-coin-official/wam-coin/blob/main/docs/START_HERE_AR.md
#
#  It is long, it looks like a filename, and it asks a reader to be
#  comfortable on GitHub before anyone has told them what a node is. So the
#  guide became wamcoin.org/start, and this now does the same for the rest.
#
#  WHY IT MATTERS BEYOND CONVENIENCE
#
#  On 4 September 2026 the founder searched Google for `wamcoin` and found the
#  gaming token, a Nigerian dairy, a Maldivian waste company and a futsal
#  match ahead of us. Our own site was not on the first three pages. Part of
#  that is a one-month-old domain and nothing fixes it but time -- but part of
#  it is that wamcoin.org was three URLs. A site with three pages gives a
#  search engine almost nothing to rank, and we were sitting on a whitepaper,
#  a build guide, a pool guide and a rehearsal record, all of them written,
#  none of them a page.
#
#  WHY GENERATED AND NOT WRITTEN
#
#  A second copy of a document is a document that will disagree with the
#  first. That has happened here twice: the site's Arabic footer denied two
#  reviewers weeks after the English half was corrected, and both guides told
#  people to download a release whose binaries had been deleted.
#
#  So the markdown stays the only source. Editing a page means editing the
#  document.
#
#  THE LINK REWRITING IS THE PART THAT WAS BROKEN
#
#  The previous version rewrote exactly two link targets, the ones between the
#  two guides. Every other relative .md link was emitted unchanged, so the
#  live /start/ page carried three links that returned 404 -- the whitepaper,
#  the build guide and the pool guide -- on the page we send every newcomer
#  to. It had been that way since the page was published, and it was found by
#  fetching them, not by reading the generator.
#
#  Now every .md link is resolved relative to its own source file and then
#  either mapped to the page built from it, or rewritten to the file on
#  GitHub. Neither outcome is a 404, and check_page_links() refuses to finish
#  if one slips through.
