#  check_docs_version.py -- do the instructions name a release that exists?
# ===========================================================================
#
#      python3 scripts/check_docs_version.py
#
#  WHY THIS EXISTS
#
#  docs/START_HERE.md and its Arabic twin are the pages written for someone
#  who has never run a node. They give exact commands to copy:
#
#      curl -LO .../releases/download/v0.1.3/wam-coin-v0.1.3-...tar.gz
#      tar -xzf wam-coin-v0.1.3-...tar.gz
#      cd wam-coin-v0.1.3/bin
#
#  Four releases later those files had been withdrawn, deliberately, because
#  v0.1.3 could not send a transaction and v0.1.4 enforced a treasury address
#  that would fork a node off mainnet at height 1. Both were superseded and
#  their binaries removed -- and the guide still pointed at them.
#
#  So the first command a beginner ran returned 404, and the page written to
#  make them feel capable made them feel stupid instead. It was found by the
#  founder reading his own documentation, not by any check here.
#
#  WHAT IS CHECKED
#
#  Every vX.Y.Z in the documentation is compared against the releases that
#  actually exist on GitHub, and against which of those still have binaries.
#  A version that was withdrawn is worse than one that is merely old: the
#  download does not fail loudly, the tag page loads and looks normal, and
#  only the asset is gone.
#
#  /releases/latest is deliberately NOT used to find the newest. It excludes
#  pre-releases, every WAM release is marked one until 1.0, and it answers
#  404 for this repository -- a check that could never pass.
