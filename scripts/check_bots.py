#  check_bots.py -- is the announcement bot alive, or merely quiet?
# ===========================================================================
#
#      python3 scripts/check_bots.py --host HOST [--network testnet]
#
#  WHY THIS EXISTS
#
#  A bot that has died looks exactly like a chain with nothing to report.
#  Both produce silence, and silence is what everyone expects most of the
#  time: the announcer speaks at milestones, halvings, seed rotations,
#  releases and stalls, and between those it says nothing for days.
#
#  So the failure is invisible by construction. The stall alert -- the one
#  message that matters most, because it fires when the chain stops -- is
#  also the message most likely to be missing when it is needed, since a
#  host in trouble takes the bot down with it.
#
#  WHAT PROVES IT IS ALIVE
#
#  Not "the service is active": a process can be running and stuck. The bot
#  writes its state file every poll, so the age of that file is proof it
#  completed a full cycle -- read the node, decide, write. If that timestamp
#  is stale the bot is not working, whatever systemd says.
#
#  WHAT PROVES IT CAN SPEAK
#
#  A configured token is not a working one. Telegram's getMe validates the
#  token and getChat proves the channel is still reachable; a Discord
#  webhook answers GET with its own metadata. All three are read-only --
#  nothing is posted to anyone's channel by this check.
#
#  Those calls run ON the host, and only their verdict comes back. The
#  token, the chat id and the webhook URL never leave the machine and never
#  appear in this output.
