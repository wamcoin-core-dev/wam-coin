#  ship.sh -- push and deploy are one act, because forgetting the second
#             half is not a mistake anybody stops making by trying harder
# ===========================================================================
#
#      bash scripts/ship.sh
#
#  WHY THIS EXISTS
#
#  On 18 September 2026 the ops panel showed
#
#      deployed code is origin/main    FAIL
#
#  three separate times in one day. Each time the cause was the same: a commit
#  was written, pushed, and the deploy was never run. Each time it was "fixed"
#  by running scripts/deploy.sh -- which fixes that commit and nothing else.
#  The founder named it: we keep repairing the same fault, and repairing an
#  instance of a fault is not fixing it.
#
#  The fault is not forgetfulness. It is that shipping is two commands and
#  only one of them is a habit. `git push` feels finished. It is not: the
#  servers run from a checkout, and a checkout that has not been pulled is
#  code nobody is running.
#
#  So the two are one command here, and the hook installed by
#  scripts/install_hooks.sh refuses a bare `git push` to main so that the
#  one-command path is the only path. Neither is a reminder. A reminder is
#  what failed three times.
#
#  WHAT IT DOES NOT DO
#
#  It does not restart a service, install a binary, or publish the site.
#  Those are three further gaps with their own checks, and rolling them in
#  here would make one command that quietly does four dangerous things.
#  Deploying is not installing, installing is not restarting, and none of the
#  three is publishing.
#
#  EXIT CODES, this project's convention
#
#      0  pushed, deployed, and every host verified to be running it
#      1  pushed but a host is not running it -- say so, loudly
#      2  nothing was pushed
# ===========================================================================
