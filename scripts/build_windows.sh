#
#  WHY THIS EXISTS, AND WHAT IT IS NOT
#
#  Every release so far is x86_64-linux-gnu and nothing else. docs/ROADMAP.md
#  §7 records why that was a mistake rather than an ordering: RandomX was
#  chosen so an ordinary desktop competes, most ordinary desktops run Windows,
#  and in a proof-of-work chain the miners ARE the security. Treating Windows
#  as a convenience to be added once "users arrive" is incoherent -- there is
#  no chain before they arrive.
#
#  This script is the measurement that turns "six days, maybe" into a fact.
#  It is NOT part of release.yml and must not become part of it until it has
#  produced a binary that syncs the test chain on a real Windows machine and
#  reaches the same tip as Linux. Compiling is not the gate. Agreeing with
#  Linux, block for block, is the gate.
#
#  WHAT MADE THIS SMALL
#
#  The thing to fear was RandomX: a custom proof-of-work linked into
#  libbitcoinkernel usually means an autotools macro, a pkg-config file and a
#  week of build-system work. It is two variables passed to configure --
#  install.sh has done it that way since the beginning:
#
#      CPPFLAGS="-I<randomx>/src"  LIBS="<randomx>/build/librandomx.a -lpthread"
#
#  So the same two variables, pointed at a mingw-built librandomx.a, is the
#  whole of the WAM-specific part. Everything else is upstream's own depends
#  system, documented in build/wam-core/doc/build-windows.md.
#
#  ARCH=x86-64, NEVER native
#
#  Same reason as scripts/fetch-upstream.sh, and it is not theoretical here
#  either. On 2026-08-20 a release went out carrying 746 AVX-512 instructions
#  because the runner's CPU had them, and it died with SIGILL on an AMD EPYC
#  that did not. RandomX detects AES-NI and the rest at RUNTIME; ARCH only
#  decides what the compiler may assume unconditionally, and for a binary
#  strangers run that has to be the baseline. A Windows binary makes this
#  worse, not better: the audience is desktops of every age.

# C++20, checked HERE rather than by configure forty minutes from now.
#
# Bitcoin Core v28 requires C++20. Ubuntu 22.04 ships mingw with GCC 10.3,
# which does not have enough of it, and configure says so:
#
#   checking whether ... supports C++20 features with -std=c++20... no
#   configure: error: *** A compiler with support for C++20 language features
#                     is required.
#
# It says it AFTER depends has built boost, bdb, libevent and sqlite for
# Windows -- about forty minutes of work that was never going to be used. The
# first run of this on a 22.04 runner spent 211 seconds to learn one fact
# about a compiler, and the fact was available in the first second.
#
# The build machine's distribution is not the release's problem here, which is
# worth stating because it looks like it should be: the Linux release is built
# on 22.04 deliberately, so its glibc runs on 22.04 and 24.04 alike. A
# cross-compiled Windows binary links against Windows DLLs and carries no
# glibc at all, so the host distribution leaves no trace in it.
# The test is the one Core's own configure runs, not one of my choosing.
#
# The first version of this guard compiled a program using std::integral and
# <concepts>, and GCC 10.3 accepted it -- so the guard passed and configure
# failed anyway, four minutes later. Writing a plausible C++20 program is not
# the same question as the one being asked.
#
# configure.ac line 123 is AX_CXX_COMPILE_STDCXX([20], [noext], [mandatory]),
# and that macro's test body begins by rejecting anything whose __cplusplus is
# below 202002L. GCC 10 with -std=c++20 reports 201709L, the pre-final value,
# which is exactly why it is refused. So that is the test here, verbatim.
#
# And the version is compared against upstream's documented floor rather than
# a number I decided: build/wam-core/doc/dependencies.md says GCC 11.1.
