#  prepare_listing_pr.sh -- stage a venue's submission on a branch
# ===========================================================================
#
#      bash scripts/prepare_listing_pr.sh bisq
#      bash scripts/prepare_listing_pr.sh --list
#
#  Clones our fork of the venue's repository, copies this repository's files
#  into the paths that venue actually reads, commits with integration/<venue>/
#  PR.md as the message, and pushes a branch. It prints the URL that opens the
#  pull request and stops there: opening it is a decision, and it is the
#  founder's.
#
#  WHY THIS IS A SCRIPT
#
#  The Bisq submission was done by hand first -- clone, copy three files,
#  insert one line in alphabetical order, commit, push. It worked, and it left
#  nothing behind that anyone could check or repeat. Where each file goes in
#  each venue's tree is a fact about that venue, discovered by reading their
#  repository, and facts like that belong in a file rather than in whoever
#  did it last.
#
#  It also means a corrected file here reaches the venue by running one
#  command again, instead of by remembering which three paths it went to.
#
#  WHAT IT WILL NOT DO
#
#  Fork a repository or open a pull request. Both need a GitHub API token, and
#  a token pasted into a chat is a token that has to be revoked. Fork by hand,
#  once, and open the pull request from the link this prints.

#
# The branch is per venue and not one name for all of them, because they are
# not all one branch. On 6 September 2026 this script would have pushed a
# corrected confirmation depth to `add-wam-coin` -- which is the branch behind
# KomodoPlatform/coins#21, the DEAD MIRROR, whose last commit was 2025-12-05.
# The live review is GLEECBTC/coins#1975 and it is built from
# `add-wam-coin-gleec`. The script would have reported success, updated the
# pull request nobody reads, and left the one under review saying 20.
#
# So `komodo` now means the repository that is actually reviewing us, and the
# mirror is a separate target that has to be named.

step "3. commit"

# Signed, because Bisq blocks a merge on it: "Commits must have verified
# signatures." The first submission was unsigned, sat there red, and had to be
# amended and force-pushed. Signing costs nothing when nobody asks and saves a
# round trip when they do.
#
# The identity is the project, not a person. The founder is not anonymous --
# he is named in the legal brief and answers the project address -- but a
# coin whose submissions carry one man's personal account reads as one man's
# hobby, and the account that happened to own his personal address was named
# with a -bot suffix, so the SLIP registration arrived attributed to a bot.
# Every submission is from WAM Coin.
#
# The address is the project one, not a personal Gmail. GitHub verifies a
# signature only when the signing key AND the committer email both belong
# to the same account: a correctly signed commit under an address the
# account does not own reports "unknown_key" and looks unsigned. The
# signature was right, the key was registered, and it still showed as
# unverified until the email changed -- two force-pushes were spent on the
# key before the cause turned out to be the other half.
#
# SSH rather than GPG: the key that already pushes to these forks can sign as
# well, so there is no new secret to make, hold or lose. GitHub treats
# authentication and signing as separate registrations of the same key, so it
# must also be added at github.com/settings/keys with type "Signing Key" --
# until then a correctly signed commit reports "unknown_key" and looks
# unsigned.
