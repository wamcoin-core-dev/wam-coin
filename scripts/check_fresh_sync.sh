#
#  WHY THIS EXISTS
#
#  On 2026-08-20 the testnet chain could not be validated from its genesis
#  block. Blocks 1 to 30 paid the 5% treasury share to the founder address;
#  block 31 onwards paid it to the separate treasury address that replaced it.
#  Current software rejects the first group:
#
#      ConnectBlock 11b46246... failed, bad-cb-devfee-amount, coinbase pays
#      0.00000000 WAM to the development treasury but consensus requires at
#      least 2.50000000 WAM ... to be sent to TQkMCz...
#
#  Both running nodes were perfectly happy. They had those blocks in their
#  chainstate from before the rule changed, and a node does not re-validate
#  history it has already accepted. Every check available agreed: the services
#  were up, the nodes ran byte-identical binaries, they held the same block at
#  the same height, the ports answered, the release matched the source.
#
#  All of them were true. All of them missed it, because every one asks about
#  a node that already has the chain. The only question that finds this is
#  whether a node that has NOTHING can get the chain -- which is also the only
#  question the network's users are actually asking.
#
#  It is found by accident or not at all: someone wipes a datadir, or a new
#  miner joins, or an exchange syncs a node for a listing. On mainnet the first
#  of those is an exchange, and the answer arrives in public.
#
#  So: a real node, an empty directory, and the chain or a reason why not.
#
#  WHAT COUNTS AS PASSING
#
#  Reaching the peer's height. Not "no errors" -- a node stuck at height 0 logs
#  its refusal once and then sits quietly, which reads like patience.

# This was a flat number, and on 2026-09-26 a fresh node reached the tip in
# 273 seconds against a limit of 300 -- twenty-seven seconds of margin, on a
# chain that adds 720 blocks a day. The check was days away from failing
# every run for no reason but arithmetic, and a red that arrives on a healthy
# system is how an operator learns to stop reading red.
#
# Syncing this chain is RandomX verification and nothing else, so the cost is
# very nearly linear in blocks. What is worth watching is therefore not the
# clock but the RATE: a node that verifies fewer than MIN_RATE blocks a
# second has genuinely got slower, and that is a regression worth a red. The
# budget below is that rate with room for a slow disk and a slow peer, plus a
# fixed allowance for starting up and finding a peer at all.
#
# Measured on 2026-09-26: 7,911 blocks in 273 s -- 29 blocks a second, on a
# 4-core VPS. MIN_RATE is set at a third of that, so the check fires when a
# machine is three times slower than the one it was measured on, not when the
# chain is merely longer than it was.

# join. Answering it with a binary built here months ago answers a different
# question, and the difference is invisible in the result.
#
# It is also not private. This starts a real node that dials the seed and
# introduces itself by version, so every run of the sweep put its version on
# the public network panel. The build in this checkout was made on 23 August
# and calls itself v0.1.5; the servers run v0.1.6. So the sweep spent the
# afternoon announcing "/WAM:0.1.5/ is on this network" -- and the founder
# spent it asking who that stranger was. It was this check.
