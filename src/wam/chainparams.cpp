// ===========================================================================
//  FOUNDER AND TREASURY ADDRESSES
// ===========================================================================
//
//  Two addresses, deliberately not one.
//
//    FOUNDER   receives the entire 2,000,000 WAM genesis premine, split across
//              five tranches. Every one of them is behind
//              OP_CHECKLOCKTIMEVERIFY; not a coin is spendable at launch.
//              They open one a year from 2027-09-15 to 2031-09-15.
//
//    TREASURY  receives 5% of every block subsidy from height 1 to
//              WAM_DEVFEE_LAST_HEIGHT (400,000) -- 750,000 WAM in total. The
//              fee expires there; it is not perpetual, and from 400,001 miners
//              keep the whole subsidy.
//
//  They were the same address once. That made the two indistinguishable on
//  chain: anyone auditing a spend could not tell operating money paying for a
//  server from the founder selling his reserve. Separating them is what makes
//  treasury spending *provable* rather than merely asserted, which serves the
//  founder before it serves anybody else.
//
//  ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
//  ON PLACEHOLDERS
//  ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
//
//  Where a real address is not yet available, the value here is a burn address
//  whose hash160 is twenty zero bytes. Nobody holds the key -- finding one
//  would mean inverting RIPEMD160(SHA256(.)) -- so anything paid to it is
//  provably destroyed, and provably so to any observer, not only to us.
//
//  It is syntactically VALID on purpose. An earlier revision used the literal
//  string "WAM_FOUNDER_ADDRESS_PLACEHOLDER", which made CChainParams::Main()
//  throw from its constructor. That is the wrong shape of guard: it did not
//  merely stop a bad launch, it made mainnet parameters impossible to
//  construct at all -- so every unit test using the default BasicTestingSetup
//  fixture (which selects MAIN) aborted, and the consensus code could not be
//  verified before a key existed. A placeholder must stop the NODE from
//  launching, not stop the class from being built.
//
//  The guards that refuse a launch while a burn address is still present live
//  in scripts/preflight.sh, scripts/audit_repo.sh and
//  docs/LAUNCH_CHECKLIST.md phase 3.
//
//  Generate a real one with
//      python3 scripts/gen_founder_key.py --network mainnet
//  on an OFFLINE machine, store the printed WIF on paper, and paste only the
//  printed address here.
//
//  No private key belonging to either address may ever appear in this
//  repository, in a build log, or in any chat transcript.
// ===========================================================================

// Generated 2026-08-17 by gen_founder_key.py on a live system running from RAM,
// with the network disabled, on a machine whose disk was never written to. The
// private key exists on paper and nowhere else: four handwritten copies, each
// one read back and checked against this address with --verify-backup while the
// screen still showed the original, before the machine was powered off.
//
// It has never been photographed, never typed into a networked device, and
// never transmitted to anyone.

//  Treasury
// ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
//
//  The 5% operating fee pays here, and it is a DIFFERENT address from the
//  founder reserve above. They used to be one, which made the two
//  indistinguishable on chain: a reader auditing a spend could not tell
//  treasury money paying for a server from the founder selling. Two addresses
//  separate them permanently, and give the founder the ability to *prove*
//  where treasury money went -- which serves him before it serves anyone else.
//
//  The mainnet value below is the same unspendable burn address the founder
//  reserve used before its ceremony: hash160 of twenty zero bytes. It is valid
//  base58check, so the node starts and testnet development continues, and
//  scripts/preflight.sh and scripts/audit_repo.sh both refuse a launch while it
//  is still here. Replace it with an address generated on an offline machine,

/**
 * ===========================================================================
 *  Networks WAM does not use
 * ===========================================================================
 *
 * Bitcoin Core v28 ships five networks: main, testnet3, testnet4, signet and
 * regtest. WAM uses three. The other two still need real definitions.
 *
 * An earlier revision made these throw, on the reasoning that a loud failure
 * beats silently placing an operator on the wrong chain. That was wrong, and
 * the unit tests caught it: SetupServerArgs() constructs EVERY chain type up
 * front in order to generate the help text for -port and -rpcport. Throwing
 * from here therefore did not merely reject `-signet` -- it aborted wamd
 * during argument setup, before it could parse a single option.
 *
 * The safe construction is a network that exists but is isolated: testnet's
 * parameters with a different P2P magic and port, and no seeds at all. A node
 * started with -signet or -testnet4 comes up on an empty network it cannot
 * confuse with any real one, because the differing magic makes the handshake
 * with a genuine WAM peer impossible.
 *
 * The genesis block is inherited unchanged from testnet, so its proof of work
 * is genuinely valid rather than a placeholder that would fail on first use.
